20344,"Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars ,",,the reform also aims to streamline administrative procedures and enhance economic efficiency.
20345,It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of,,"new accounting standards are crucial for maintaining accurate and relevant financial reporting, ensuring transparency, and facilitating informed decision-making."

22608,The church truly is not a rest home,,for the weary soul but a gymnasium for the spirit.
22609,It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less,,concerned with the practical applications of their research.
22610,No single explanation is adequate,,to account for the complexity of human behavior.
22611,"Improvement , however , is urgent , and",,requires immediate action to address the existing issues effectively.
22612,The first is a wide-ranging,,The first is a wide-ranging exploration
22613,Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of,,languages and linguistic structures to understand the diversity and universality in human communication.
22614,An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of,,"various literary devices, theoretical concepts, and analytical frameworks, enabling them to critically evaluate and interpret complex texts."
22615,"By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of",,"human languages than a dozen or so, highlighting the vast diversity and number of languages worldwide."
22616,This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena,,This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena hinders a comprehensive understanding of the subject.

22623,They will give suggestions that can,,help you improve your project.
22624,Good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better,,data collection but also enhance their ability to analyze and interpret linguistic patterns effectively in diverse cultural contexts.
22625,"Actually , none of these papers",,"Actually, none of these papers provided the information I needed."

22627,"These things have been disseminated by other means , but",,"these methods have proven less reliable, more costly, or slower in reaching a wide audience."
22628,The third need is,,"often associated with belonging and love, as per Maslow's hierarchy of needs."
22629,We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for,,describing the sound patterns of all languages as it is for any single language.
22630,One issue that must be faced is the,,increasing divide between technological advancement and digital accessibility.
22631,"Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems ,",,they are often less complex and can be mastered with relatively less effort.
22632,Actual practice does not often,,align with theoretical knowledge.
22633,Tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would,,suggest.
22634,Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters,,pitch levels.
22635,This may both divert the attention of the,,audience and subtly influence their perception of the situation.
22636,The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features,,from the non-linguistic context in which they are used.
22637,"Of course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of",,"Of course, something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of society."
22638,But in general the individual variation is a small,,portion of the total variation observed.
22639,"With tone , individual differences may be greater than",,"with tone, individual differences may be greater than with content."
22640,"Pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional",,"state to another, can significantly affect the perception and interpretation of speech."
22641,A second explanation is suggested by,,the alternative theory that proposes
22642,Tone and intonation often,,convey the emotional content of speech.
22643,Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the,,Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the underlying principles from the superficial characteristics.
22644,Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact,,"in complex ways within different languages, influencing pronunciation and perception."
22645,"for example , duration sometimes figures in",,determining the cost of a hotel stay.
22646,"Some phonetic features , for example glottal catch or murmur , are",,not universally present in all languages.
22647,But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to,,master as tones and vowel harmony.
22648,"This explanation of tone difficulties , however",,"This explanation of tone difficulties, however, clarifies the challenges in conveying emotions accurately through text."
22649,In some ( the Ewe type mentioned above ) interaction of,,"In some (the Ewe type mentioned above) interaction of cultural practices and linguistic features, unique social dynamics emerge."
22650,"In many of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and",,the focus should be on pronunciation and clarity instead.
22651,"Still , even in such languages tone analysis has",,proved valuable for understanding nuances in meaning and emotion.
22652,A third explanation is suggested by,,"the recent findings in the field of neuroscience, which indicate that..."
22653,There we see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed,,"in a complex web of allophonic variations and sociolinguistic influences, showcasing the intricate relationship between simplicity in structure and diversity in expression."
22654,"In the `` typical tone language '' , tonal morphophonemics",,refers to how pitch contours can signal different grammatical or lexical meanings in languages where tone is a key phonological feature.
22655,The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic,,The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic contrasts are often complex and highly structured.
22656,"The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly",,used in speech and music vary significantly across different cultures and languages.
22657,Consonantal systems are not merely,,collections of consonants but intricate patterns that distinguish phonemic contrasts in languages.
22658,Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as,,"a set of linguistic guidelines that dictate how sounds change based on their environment within a word or phrase, impacting the pronunciation and sometimes the spelling."
22659,"The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous ,",,as different combinations and articulations of consonants can create a wide variety of sounds and phonetic structures in languages around the world.
22660,Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic,,similarity.
22661,"Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can",,"be observed in languages where pitch variations affect the meaning of words, leading to different tonal variants that may change the form or pronunciation of morphemes."
22662,"The possibilities are few , and the total",,options are limited.
22663,"Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect",,", thus creating redundancy within the regulatory framework."
22664,Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal,,morphophonemics because the subtle variations in pitch and their impact on word meaning are less intuitive and harder to detect compared to changes in consonant sounds.
22665,The statement of the system,,"The statement of the system outlines its boundaries, components, and the interactions between those components as well as with its environment."
22666,Smaller systems can of course,,be less complex and easier to manage.
22667,A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics,,", but understanding the full linguistic system may require considering both."
22668,The design of orthographies has received much less,,attention than the development of alphabets and writing systems.
22669,Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to,,"the issue, avoiding deeper analysis or commitment."
22670,Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses,,and a departure from clarity and simplicity.
22671,Many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most,,basic functionalities implemented.
22672,Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes,,they have fallen into the same prescriptive traps or biases.
22673,"As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography",,is crucial for clear communication.
22674,His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it,,is possible to make in the speech sounds ''.
22675,"To do so , he finds it necessary to examine",,the underlying principles and assumptions closely.
22676,"In the process , he develops some very significant observations",,about the underlying patterns that govern complex systems.

22679,Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in,,the context of its linguistic environment before reaching a conclusion.
22680,I hope his suggestions are given the,,consideration they deserve.
