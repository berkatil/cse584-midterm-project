18982,They began to describe in detail,,the events that had transpired.

19040,"Mickey's guts twisted with the effort , but",,he managed to hold it together.
19041,It moved in a silver arc toward,,the target.
19042,He hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm,,with his knife.
19043,Before Roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his,,"opponent's ribs, the referee called a halt to the match."
19044,Roberts sagged and slashed,,"through the dense undergrowth, his movements weary but determined."

19055,The sound of his head striking the solid,,ground was a chilling reminder of his fall.
19056,He fell on his side across the lowest step,,"and lay there, breathless and stunned."
19057,"Mickey found himself leaning against the desk ,",,lost in thought.

19061,Suddenly it was cold,,"and the wind picked up, sending shivers down her spine."
19062,It seemed to him that a long time,,had passed since he last saw her.

19076,He left the rest of his,,meal uneaten.

19092,The Jeep fought its way through the,,"mud, tires spinning and engine roaring."
19093,He drove in low gear to the fork in the road and,,then shifted into high gear as he accelerated down the straightaway.
19094,"He went back and got the flashlight , returned to the tunnel and",,"shone the light inside, revealing the darkness ahead."
19095,He tossed the bag into the pit and,,walked away.

19097,It wasn't like,,it was supposed to be.
19098,The soft snow,,"fell gently, blanketing the world in a serene white."

19104,It would be a,,shame to miss this opportunity.
19105,It was a bad place for Roberts to wind,,up.
19106,It was too late,,to change the plans.
19107,He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse,,into the shallow grave.
19108,It was a relief to,,find out that everything was fine.
19109,He was shaking with tension and it took him a,,while to calm down.
19110,Then he got on his knees and,,began to pray.
19111,It hung momentarily on the,,edge of the cliff.
19112,"He gave it a strong push , heard it",,roll away.

19119,He made his way,,through the crowded room.
19120,He had started to back into the turn,,when he heard a loud screech of tires behind him.
19121,"He climbed down , went back into the",,house.
19122,"It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised",,as if ready to strike.
19123,He went back once more to the Jeep,,", started the engine, and drove away into the night."
19124,In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs,,of damage.
19125,There were stains here and there and he cleaned them off,,with a damp cloth.

19128,"There were tire marks where it had been , but they were overlapped by",,fresh footprints.

19179,"It fixed on Dartmouth College , which was",,a private institution that had been chartered by the state of New Hampshire.
19180,The legislators decided to `` liberate '' Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with,,the school's trustees.

19182,The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in,,the case of McCulloch v. Maryland.

19189,"It was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock's was",,the only suitable location.
19190,The governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver,,tray adorned with intricate engravings.
19191,The exuberance on this occasion set,,the tone for a memorable celebration.
19192,A student orator `` produced tears from a great number,,of the audience. ''

19214,Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum,,that were once considered radical.
19215,President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral an,,unruly crowd with a speech that inspired unity and cooperation.
19216,This does not mean that mythological language as such,,is inherently false or without value.
19217,The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation,,"of all mythic elements from a text or tradition, rather than a critical reevaluation and reinterpretation, persists in some scholarly circles."
19218,But this statement,,is incomplete and requires further context to be fully understood.
19219,"In fact , it is in just such a",,situation that we find ourselves now.

19228,This is what we mean when we say,,"""This is what we mean when we say"""
19229,This must be stressed because it is absolutely,,crucial.
19230,"Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us",,", is a man who has come of age and must take responsibility for his actions."
19231,and those of us who so richly benefit from,,the hard work and sacrifices of others owe it to them to be grateful and pay it forward.
19232,It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures,,owe their inspiration and artistic vision.
19233,"However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations , the theology we",,propose must be equally rigorous and thoughtful.
19234,In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the,,spell of passivity and complacency.
19235,If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by,,those who wish to remain relevant in contemporary discourse.

19242,"An interne , a nurse and two",,doctors walked into the room.
19243,I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the,,"window, watching the rain fall."
19244,We had become good friends during,,our time at university.
19245,I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that,,had been circulating about me.
19246,She knew also that I was unmarried,,and that I had no immediate family.
19247,`` I read those newspaper stories about,,"the latest political scandal, but I find it hard to believe everything I read.```"
19248,"`` You must have loved that girl very much , but you couldn't",,be with her.

19252,You're not the kind,,of person who gives up easily.
19253,Were you in love with,,her?
19254,`` Would it make any difference to you if,,I found out that you were lying to me?''
19255,She met my eyes,,and held my gaze.
19256,`` I wouldn't have gone into nursing,,if I knew it would be this stressful.
19257,I'm interested in every patient,,I'm interested in every patient's well-being and progress.
19258,When I think of people like you,,I think of kindness and intelligence.
19259,"`` You what , Mary",,"You what, Mary?"
19260,I don't blame that girl for,,I don't blame that girl for wanting to pursue her dreams.
19261,"`` Oh , yes '' , I said ,",,my heart racing with excitement.
19262,You don't believe that I'm going back to medical,,"school, do you?"
19263,I've worked this ward,,for five years.
19264,We keep getting the same,,results.
19265,"They all mean well , have great promises to make when they",,"campaign, but often fall short once elected."
19266,You've not seemed like them,,You've not seemed like them.
19267,You've treated your stay here,,as a vacation.
19268,It's not a joke to be sent to,,prison.
19269,I wanted to go to,,the park.
19270,`` Why didn't you,,call me back?
19271,`` Chicago has some of,,the best deep-dish pizza in the country.```
19272,`` That's what I mean about you,,always misunderstanding me.

19274,I'll tell you why I didn't,,come to the meeting yesterday.
19275,I'm the oldest,,I'm the oldest in my family.

19277,"There was no money for tuition , for clothes ,",,for food.
19278,Nurses' training here,,"Nurses' training here is rigorous and comprehensive, covering both theoretical knowledge and practical skills."
19279,They even pay me,,to do what I love.
19280,I think it's,,going to rain today.
19281,`` Do you have a,,moment?
19282,"`` That's none of your business '' ,",,"she snapped, turning away angrily."
19283,"`` What about your father and mother , don't you think of",,them?
19284,`` My father and mother died when I,,"was young, so I was raised by my grandparents.''"
19285,Aunt Mary died when I,,was ten years old.
19286,I have no one but,,myself to blame.
19287,Something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed,,and she softened her tone.
19288,`` I'm sorry '',,is all I can say.
19289,`` I don't know what,,I don't know what to do next.
19290,We've always been,,close friends.
19291,`` Tell me more,,"about what you're interested in, and I'll share more details."
19292,Her eyes became bright as she talked about her,,dreams.
19293,"Listening , I felt cheated and",,disappointed.
19294,When she had finished,,"her work, she left the office."
19295,`` Your dad sounds like a,,great guy.
19296,`` My father is a sergeant of detectives and,,my mother is a retired school teacher. ''
19297,He's a pretty good judge,,of character.
19298,I don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure,,that it was for a good cause.
19299,How would you feel about it if I were to ask you,,to go for a walk in the park?
19300,What about your that girl you were,,talking about?
19301,I can say this : I'm dead,,I can say this: I'm alive.
19302,"As for that other girl , let's just say",,she's not someone you need to worry about.
19303,You will get to come home on long weekends,,if your work schedule allows it.
19304,"`` Yes , I'll get",,"`` Yes, I'll get right on it. ```"
19305,`` We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach,,``We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach and enjoy the sunset.''
19306,`` Do you like,,Do you like ice cream?
19307,They always have a,,plan.
19308,"`` I like to dance '' , she",,said with a smile.
19309,There hadn't been anything really personal,,"in the message, just a general greeting."
19310,It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward,,and it pained her to see them suffer.
19311,It seemed the most important thing in my life at this,,moment.
19312,Only two people in the state of Illinois knew that I was,,"alive and well, hidden away in that small town."
19313,It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as,,her would miss the hint.
19314,"But I had the proof , all documented in a legal agreement which",,stated the terms and conditions clearly.
19315,I wondered suddenly as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the,,radio.
19316,"Perhaps this was reality and Dale Nelson ,",,"the man who always doubted, was finally seeing things as they truly were."
19317,a figment of,,your imagination.
19318,I had come to Chicago from New York early,,in the morning.
19319,"No one , not even the producer , had",,any idea that the movie would become such a massive hit.
19320,The critics literally,,panned the movie.
19321,Ask Tony was doomed from the moment Kupcinet,,decided to challenge him.
19322,We opened on Friday and,,the response was overwhelming.
19323,Out of the entire cast I alone received good,,reviews.
19324,This let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest,,of the group.
19325,We were paid off Tuesday morning and,,we planned to celebrate that night.
19326,I felt lonely and depressed as I,,"sat alone in my room, staring at the walls."
19327,It seemed to me that my life was,,a series of endless possibilities.
19328,"Then later I had quit my safe , secure five-a-week spot on",,the assembly line to chase my dreams.
19329,It seemed to me that I was not,,welcome.
19330,I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy,,to collect.
19331,When I answered it a voice too dignified and British,,"to be anyone I knew said, ""Hello, may I speak with Mr. Smith, please?"""
19332,`` All right '',,`` I'll do it. ''
19333,`` Why don't you bastards lay off,,me?
19334,`` I beg your pardon,,", but I didn't quite understand what you meant."
19335,This is Dale Nelson,,", a name that might be familiar to those in the local community for his contributions to charity and his leadership in the business sector."
19336,I'm calling you,,because I need your help.
19337,Could you possibly have lunch,,with me today?
19338,His car could pick you up,,if you tell me where you are.
19339,"`` You'll send the Rolls-Royce ,",,`` and I'll meet you at the opera. ``
19340,"`` Yes , of",,course.
19341,I started to say something else appropriate,,but then I realized it might not be the right time or place.
19342,I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of,,the guests were gathered for drinks and conversation.
19343,They all bowed low,,in respect.
19344,"`` All right , you bastards '' , I said ,",,"`` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` you want to play dirty, we'll play dirty. ''"
19345,I laid a tenspot on the bar and,,the bartender gave me a nod.
19346,He had just returned my change when the doorman,,announced that the building was on lockdown.
19347,`` You,,`` You complete me. ``
19348,``,,The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
19349,I followed him out through,,the door and into the street.
19350,"An ancient Rolls-Royce , as shiningly impressive as the day it",,"was first driven off the assembly line, rolled gracefully down the street."
19351,"The elderly chauffeur , immaculate in a dark uniform , stood",,at attention by the open door of the limousine.
19352,"With respect to this view ,",,I disagree.
19353,"First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its",,"own, the evidence does not conclusively prove the hypothesis."
19354,It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus,,"'' in the original Latin text, meaning ""No less."""
19355,More believed that a man could,,achieve great things through hard work and dedication.
19356,Utopia is still widely read because in a,,"world that often seems chaotic and unjust, it offers a vision of an ideal society that continues to inspire and challenge readers."
19357,Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian,,monk.
19358,More stands on the margins of modernity for,,those who feel disconnected from mainstream society.
19359,Only one other contemporary of More's evokes so immediate and direct a response,,as Erasmus.
19360,Can we discover what it is in Utopia,,that makes everyone happy?
19361,Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny,,the value of tradition and history.
19362,we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable,,scale.
19363,To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of,,"the event, the surface details are merely a starting point."
19364,But here we have a,,different situation.
19365,we want to know why that book has kept,,we want to know why that book has kept its popularity over the years.
19366,we want to know what,,you think about the new policy.
19367,What is new about,,"the latest smartphone model is its advanced camera system, featuring a high-resolution sensor and improved low-light performance."
19368,To that question the answer,,is yes.
19369,it can be made in,,a variety of ways.
19370,But it is an answer which opens the door,,to more questions.
19371,Surely there is nothing,,that can compare to the beauty of a sunrise.
19372,"We find it in Plato's Republic , and in",,Aristotle's Politics.
19373,We find it in the later Stoic conception of man's,,"place in the universe, where he is seen as a rational being capable of understanding and living in accordance with the natural order."
19374,This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and,,was further developed in their writings.
19375,and More was far too well read not to have come across,,the works of Plato and Aristotle.
19376,"we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is , simply communism as",,"an idealized vision of a society where there is no private property, no class distinctions, and where the means of production are owned collectively by the community"
19377,Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism,,"is to consider how it envisions a future where technology and social organization are harmonized to create a classless, equitable society."
19378,We will achieve a more vivid sense of what,,we are capable of by pushing our limits and exploring new possibilities.
19379,In Plato's Republic communism is -- to,,In Plato's Republic communism is -- to ensure that the guardians are free from the corrupting influence of wealth and private property.
19380,"Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass ,",,the derived or differentiated cells.
19381,and it is to this problem,,that we must now turn our attention.
19382,In More's Utopia communism is not a means of,,"In More's Utopia communism is not a means of oppression or control, but rather a foundation for equality and communal well-being."
19383,Utopian communism applies,,to an idealized form of society where property is communally owned and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs.
19384,And in the economy of the book,,every word counts.
19385,The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu,,", which translates to ""the best state of the commonwealth."""
19386,and it is again and again made clear that Utopian,,societies are impossible to achieve.
19387,The apostolic community was literally an,,extended family.
19388,In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in,,"time, beyond the reach of immediate concern."
19389,The actual function of patristic communism,,"is to promote a communal way of life based on shared resources and mutual support, reflecting early Christian ideals."
19390,`` The soil is,,"`` The soil is rich and fertile, perfect for growing a variety of crops. ``"
19391,When we give the necessities of life to the poor,,we fulfill our duty as human beings.
19392,We should think of it more as,,an opportunity rather than a challenge.
19393,Because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no,,one should claim exclusive ownership over natural resources.
19394,"Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and",,"indeed, of all that is his every man is by nature and necessity the owner."
19395,The Utopians brace conscience,,with laws.
19396,In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous,,forms of communism.
19397,Neither from one of these conceptions nor from,,the other can we derive a satisfactory conclusion.
19398,We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales,,in earlier myths and legends.
19399,It is not merely a,,question of money.
19400,it is one of the very few,,it is one of the very few
19401,most of the rest is medieval or humanist or,,Renaissance.
19402,But to say that at a moment in history something is new,,is to recognize its emergence and significance.
19403,Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous,,"Consider the features of Utopian communism: generous distribution of resources, equality among all members, and a harmonious society without class distinctions."
19404,democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests,,are essential for ensuring fair representation and maintaining the trust of the community.
19405,a common habit or uniform prescribed,,for employees in a workplace is wearing a specific type of attire or following a dress code.
19406,even houses changed once,,they were built differently in the past.
19407,six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates,,is the new policy implemented to address unemployment and promote physical health in the community.
19408,"no private property ,",,no personal possessions.
19409,"no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services ,",,"a world without money or trade, where everything is freely shared or provided."
19410,"Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive",,"to be realistically implemented in a complex, diverse society."
19411,"It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern ,",,but rather its emphasis on equality and social justice.
19412,"If so , are you saying , `` Where",,are you going? ''
19413,How did I get to be,,so tall?
19414,What do I do,,It depends on the situation you're in. Could you provide more details?
19415,"Yes , retirement seems to",,be a welcome change after years of hard work.
19416,Somehow we old-timers never figured,,out how to stay young.
19417,We always thought we would,,grow old together.
19418,Out of the blue comes,,a surprise visit from an old friend.
19419,Compulsory retirement at sixty-five,,is a policy that requires individuals to retire from their jobs when they reach the age of sixty-five.

19696,These frescos have had no,,restoration.
19697,"Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson , but",,it does touch on a few key stages relevant to our topic.
19698,The adolescent experiences identity crises in,,the process of transitioning from childhood to adulthood.
19699,Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter,,stillness to a feeling of rapid acceleration.
19700,These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some,,studies on temporal processing.
19701,Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any,,cause or concern.
19702,The adolescent experiences two closely,,related growth spurts during puberty.
19703,"However , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during",,"his early years, by loving and supportive caregivers, he is more likely to develop a strong sense of security and self-worth."
19704,inculcated with the primacy of group,,"thinking and harmony, she always prioritized the team's success over her own ambitions."
19705,To be different is to invite,,curiosity and challenge.
19706,"The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 , , revealed both",,a sense of resilience and a struggle with societal judgment.
19707,Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means,,to an end.
19708,but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be,,reciprocated for a true sense of belonging to develop.
19709,Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent,,is the struggle to define their sexual orientation and gender identity.
19710,"If she has not had such experiences , the",,"If she has not had such experiences, the"
19711,whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or,,seek financial independence through a job or other means.

19713,and whether to attend this or that college and,,whether to attend this or that college and pursue a specific major or career path can be a daunting decision.
19714,"Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts ,",,the individual may experience a sense of role confusion.
19715,This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting -- and never completing,,tasks or projects.
19716,The comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in,,the article) reflect their struggles and resilience.
19717,They attended school and selected courses primarily on,,the basis of their interests and career goals.
19718,they accepted a job primarily because it was,,close to home.
19719,"As their identity diffusion increased , they became more",,uncertain about their goals and values.

19722,"For example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences ,",,while others had held various jobs before and during their pregnancies.
19723,they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in,,pursuing various hobbies and interests.
19724,The adolescent also faces the identity crisis,,during the transition from childhood to adulthood.
19725,In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention,,"of future crises, it is essential to examine the underlying causes and systemic issues that contributed to the current situation."
19726,"Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as",,either all good or all bad.

19783,"It made him a little sick ,",,but he had to do it anyway.

19812,He watched the half-breed,,with a mix of curiosity and disdain.

19824,`` I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a,,real adventure.

19831,She brought up her free hand to hit,,him.
19832,He side-stepped her blow and she,,"stumbled forward, off balance."
19833,She finally regained her balance and,,continued on her way.
19834,He had forgotten that,,he had left his keys at home.
19835,"But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all",,her other qualities seemed to fade in comparison.
19836,He had known women like that,,before.

19855,But they were starting,,to realize the truth.
19856,"And they had almost everything they needed : land ,",,"water, seeds, tools, and a plan."
19857,The land wasn't all Wilson,,owned.
19858,"Six hundred and forty acres ,",,is the size of a square mile.
19859,"Well , the grass was there , though in some places the",,ground showed through.
19860,"The water was there , so much of it",,that it seemed endless.
19861,And there was a,,a moment of silence.
19862,"livable perhaps , but badly",,"livable perhaps, but badly in need of repair."
19863,"In the last analysis , though ,",,it all comes down to personal choice.
19864,The place had been cheap -- just the little he had,,saved up over time.
19865,There was only one place where Jake Carwood's description,,matched the suspect's: the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.
19866,It hadn't started,,yet.
19867,And he had a feeling -- thanks to the girl,,that everything was going to be alright.
19868,"They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent",,the kids to the park.
19869,He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the,,lock.
19870,Kathy was already,,late for the meeting.
19871,"They were going to town ,",,but the road was closed due to construction.
19872,"Wilson backed the team into the traces , and",,the horses started pulling the wagon forward.
19873,He had an uneasy,,feeling.
19874,"That girl last night , what",,was her name again?
19875,It was the only thing about her that,,he couldn't stand.
19876,He finished with the team and filled,,in for the injured player.
19877,"He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in",,"the afternoon, he planned to rest and tend to his chores."
19878,"There was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow",,under.
19879,"Yes , there was plenty of water , too",,", but it didn't solve the problem."
19880,There were tracks of cattle all over,,the muddy field.
19881,"The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled",,off after a while.
19882,"It was hotter once they reached the flat ,",,desert-like terrain.
19883,A warm breeze played across it,,", rustling the leaves gently."
19884,"A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any",,sign of danger.
19885,It took them an hour before they,,finally found the lost keys.
19886,"Rather than being deceived , the",,truth is often more comforting.
19887,"instead of seeing objects in space , it",,senses changes in the fabric of spacetime.
19888,"To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and",,"Picasso began to incorporate real pieces of paper, newspaper clippings, and other materials into their paintings."
19889,the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality,,of the medium and the process of its making.
19890,"In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to",,"introduce a more structured and geometric approach, incorporating elements of Cubism."
19891,"that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the",,frame that they seem to be part of the scene itself.
19892,"The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the",,effect of making the room look cluttered and disorganized.
19893,"The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the",,importance of maintaining unique characteristics and individuality.
19894,It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than,,his later works.
19895,But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in,,the development of Cubism.
19896,"and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the",,curriculum.
19897,When we examine what each master says was his first collage,,we find that their accounts vary significantly.
19898,( It makes no real difference that Braque's collage is on paper and eked,,"out with pencil, while Picasso's is on canvas and painted. )"
19899,"But here again , the surface-declaring device both",,conceals and reveals the true nature of the object.
19900,"Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper",,is prone to wrinkling and tearing.
19901,"And the surface is driven back , in",,response to the force applied.
19902,and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their,,own hinterlands.
19903,Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place,,"Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving visual experience."
19904,and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of,,the world is the one defined by the constant flux and change that characterizes them.
19905,"And the same thing , more or less , can",,be said about many other situations.
19906,Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space,,"Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space, creating intersections and dividing the space into distinct regions."
19907,All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass,,a broader spectrum of meaning and interpretation.
19908,"rather , it underpins and reinforces",,the existing power structures.
19909,Out of this re-created literalness,,arises a new form of abstraction.
19910,"In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not",,yet introduced color into their works.
19911,"In order to be saved , plasticity",,must be preserved.
19912,"Cubism , in its 1911-1912 phase ( which the French , with justice",,", called ""hermetic""), was a radical break from traditional perspective and representation, emphasizing abstraction and the simultaneous depiction of multiple viewpoints."
19913,It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a,,new challenge in their artistic collaboration.
19914,"In the end , Picasso and Braque plumped for the",,collage technique.
19915,( This provides whatever real justification there is,,for the policies being implemented. )
19916,") But the inner , formal logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out",,", was a rigorous exploration of form and space, leading to a new visual language that broke away from traditional perspective."
19917,"Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would",,remain invisible to the naked eye.
19918,"and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated",,against the white background of the canvas.
19919,and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject,,"and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject, creating a harmonious and identifiable image."
19920,Analytical Cubism came to an end in the,,early 1910s.
19921,nor did Synthetic Cubism,,nor did Synthetic Cubism emerge until after 1912.
19922,"Synthetic Cubism began with Picasso alone , late",,in 1912.
19923,this was the point at which he finally took the lead in,,the game.
19924,"But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a",,"brief moment, the world of Cubism."
19925,"Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut out and folded a",,piece of paper to create a three-dimensional form.
19926,"The affixed elements of collage were extruded , as it were ,",,from the flat surface into three-dimensional space.
19927,note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with,,"a subtle, shimmering quality that catches the light."
19928,Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ),,were indeed responsible for the outcome.
19929,"And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt",,", was laced with an undercurrent of menace."

19935,"For example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there",,is no reason to believe that you will suddenly become mentally unstable.
19936,The usual,,suspects.
19937,"The symbols of mother's status , here",,"are her wedding ring, her family photos, and her heirloom jewelry."
19938,"this is a `` fade '' ending , and what you have here is",,"the final scene, where everything gradually disappears into darkness."
19939,Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with : Af In,,"Af In, a brand of frozen meals, seems to lack the warmth and personal touch associated with homemade dishes like mom's apple pie."
19940,"And while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered ,",,the tone and connotation can still vary significantly.
19941,An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the,,interview is essential for a comprehensive analysis.
19942,Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics,,who are applying their knowledge to improve voice recognition and natural language processing technologies.
19943,By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews,,we can enhance the depth and accuracy of the data interpretation.
19944,Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points,,of interest for further analysis.

19950,Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to,,me that you are highly qualified for the position.
19951,"She says later , but still within the opening five minutes , ``",,"""I can't believe we're actually doing this."""

19955,This the therapist may,,use various techniques to help the client.
19956,"His own communication apparatus operated superbly , and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly",,his mastery of the craft.
19957,"almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on",,"tape, is surprised by how they sound."
19958,to spot these giveaways the therapist must know,,the subtle signs and cues that indicate underlying issues.
19959,"Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my",,doctor.''
19960,What he does do is give himself away by,,what he says and how he acts.
19961,Some of the classic indicators,,"of inflation include rising prices, decreasing purchasing power, and increased interest rates."
19962,"Stammering or repetition of I , you , he ,",,can indicate nervousness or uncertainty in speech.
19963,The word that is not used can be as,,significant as the word that is used.
19964,therapist and linguist must,,collaborate to develop effective communication strategies for clients with language disorders.
19965,`` You can't stay,,here forever.
19966,It's late and you said they'd,,be here by now.
19967,`` You can't make,,an omelette without breaking eggs.
19968,Gavin sank down again into his,,"chair, feeling utterly defeated."
19969,He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there,,alone in the chaos.
19970,It was the only thing in his,,room that he truly cherished.
19971,Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his,,lips.
19972,Clayton tried to call back the face,,but it slipped away into the shadows of his mind.
19973,Against that other man he could,,not stand a chance.
19974,against this bent man in,,"the dimly lit alley, she stood her ground."
19975,Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had,,to lean in closer to hear what he was saying.
19976,`` Do you remember Big,,Do you remember Big Bird?
19977,`` He stuck with,,`` his plan. ``
19978,"Just a half-breed 'pache , never said much , never",,"did much, either."
19979,He got into a fight with,,his brother.
19980,"It was a fair fight , the boy",,stood his ground and faced his opponent with courage.
19981,"They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body",,in the river.
19982,"My men , they",,are ready for battle.
19983,I didn't understand,,the instructions.
19984,"He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then",,spat on the ground.
19985,`` Do you mean '' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you,,do you mean you''
19986,`` You don't hate me,,", do you?''"
19987,"Clayton choked , shook his head",,", and tried to speak, but no words came out."
19988,The old man beckoned with one finger,,and the young boy approached cautiously.
19989,Gavin slipped his arms around his,,waist.
19990,"`` All my life '' ,",,I've been waiting for this moment.
19991,I saw you driftin away,,like a cloud in the sky.
19992,And you wanted no part of me,,And you wanted no part of me.
19993,Now there's nothin,,'left to lose.
19994,"Laurel is gone , my men are gone , Ed is",,gone.
19995,"God in Heaven , I",,"God in Heaven, I pray for your guidance and strength."
19996,That would mock me,,to laugh at me.
19997,Can't let you go way from me again '',,Can't let you go away from me again.
19998,`` I'll go,,I'll go.
19999,Clayton freed himself from the,,restraints.
20000,I'll saddle the horses,,and we'll head out at first light.
20001,He burst from the hot confinement of,,the crowded sauna.
20002,Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket,,before mounting the horse.
20003,When he had finished he led him,,out of the room.
20004,The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and,,"his instincts took over, urging him to find her."
20005,Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda,,post and dismounted gracefully.
20006,"`` You take it easy ,",,`` and I'll handle everything.```
20007,`` She doesn't,,`` She doesn't understand the situation. ``
20008,"You take it easy ,",,I'll relax and enjoy the day.
20009,Gavin stood on the porch,,and watched the rain fall.
20010,He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed,,behind him as he moved.
20011,Clayton called to him and he,,turned around.
20012,"`` Clay '' , he said , ``",,I need you to listen to me. ''
20013,`` To a ranch,,"`` To a ranch, she brought her horse and supplies, ready for a long stay. ``"
20014,There's someone there I,,know.
20015,We may take her with,,us.
20016,"I don't know yet ,",,but I will find out.
20017,I have to,,I have to go now.
20018,But California is where,,the dream is always shining bright.
20019,A man could make,,a difference.
20020,"Two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine",,"Two men, together like us, we could do something fine."
20021,"Start out fresh , the two of us",,"Start out fresh, the two of us, with no baggage from the past."
20022,"`` Yes , like a",,"`` Yes, like a dream come true. ''"
20023,`` I made you what you,,are.
20024,`` I made you so,,`` you should be grateful.''
20025,I made you,,a sandwich.
20026,"`` Yes , Gavin",,", I'll make sure to attend the meeting tomorrow."
20027,He approached the horse and laid a,,hand on its neck.
20028,`` Help me,,"Please, can you tell me what you need help with?"
20029,"Help me up , I",,can't reach it on my own.
20030,Clayton lifted him gently into the,,air.
20031,`` I hate to leave my,,home.
20032,`` It will grow again,,``It will grow again.```
20033,`` I loved this valley,,`` I loved this valley when the sun painted it gold and the rivers sang in the breeze. ''
20034,`` Lived alone here for three,,years.
20035,"It was nice then ,",,but it's even better now.
20036,There was no,,There was no sign of life.
20037,Clayton swung into the saddle,,and urged his horse forward.
20038,"The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light",,and disappeared into the darkness.
20039,they rode at a measured,,pace.
20040,Dawn would come soon and the,,night would fade into light.
20041,In that inert landscape the caravan of,,"camels moved slowly, their shadows stretching long in the fading light."
20042,"He saw them ambushed , strewn in the",,"field, their bodies torn and broken."
20043,In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he,,had once known.
20044,They passed ranches that were framed,,by towering mountains and sprawling plains.
20045,Then at last the,,Then at last the door creaked open.
20046,A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains,,"and stretched across the sky, painting the horizon with its vibrant hue."
20047,The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the,,morning mist.
20048,The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves,,"off the saddles, landing with a thud on the dusty ground."
20049,The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a,,long day of work.
20050,But the liquor had,,already been poured.
20051,"They greeted the news angrily , as",,if they had expected something better.
20052,"Lester heard their muttering , saw",,their furtive glances.
20053,He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek,,", as if he were savoring an invisible morsel."
20054,"That's what you wanted ,",,isn't it?
20055,"Clayton is with him , takin",,g a stroll through the park.
20056,`` Keep out of this,,`` Keep out of this matter.``
20057,`` He's not your brother,,", he's your cousin."
20058,"You see , he lied to us when",,he said he would be there.
20059,Joe Purvis was thinking,,about his next move.
20060,First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him,,about the danger that was coming.
20061,"He remembered Gavin's smirk , his",,"arrogant tone, and the way he crossed his arms."
20062,Then he thought of a time when Clayton's,,"smile was as bright as the sun, and everything seemed possible."
20063,His wife had said to him : ``,,"""I don't want to talk about it right now."""
20064,He wouldn't even dance with,,her.
20065,He treats her like,,a queen.
20066,And you stand by like a fool,,while the world burns around you.
20067,He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked,,for a fair fight.
20068,It was the night Clayton had,,been waiting for all year.
20069,`` You're Gavin's son '',,"`` Yes, I am. ''"
20070,`` You brought him back to this valley,,", didn't you?''"
20071,He meant to help,,but he only made things worse.
20072,He made a fool of,,himself.
20073,He swung round to the other men --,,his face flushed with anger.
20074,There are plenty of fresh,,There are plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables at the market.
20075,"If we let them go , they won't stay away ,",,they'll come back.
20076,There's only one way they can get out now and that's through,,the door.
20077,Lester's hand fluttered,,nervously.
20078,`` He killed Tom -- do,,`` He killed Tom -- don't you understand?''
20079,Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were,,brothers.
20080,They mounted up and rode slowly behind,,the hearse.
20081,"in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then",,"the sun rose, casting a golden glow that slowly burned the mist away."
20082,When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind,,"them, but the trail was lost in the dust."
20083,"The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were",,galloping freely across the open plains.
20084,The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the,,need to slow down.
20085,He looked over his shoulder at,,"the dark, empty alley."
20086,They neither gained,,nor lost.
20087,He rode low on,,the saddle.
20088,Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed,,"to a small, hidden path leading into the dense forest."
20089,Gavin's face was,,a mask of determination.
20090,He did not look,,back.
20091,he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of,,the rain against the windowpane.
20092,Now they were riding,,"down the dusty trail, the sun setting behind them."
20093,"And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his",,past.
20094,The land over which he sped was the land,,of his ancestors.
20095,With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch,,"of ground, closing the distance between him and his goal."
20096,California is too far,,to reach by foot in a day.
20097,He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines,,"to run swiftly, his steps were slow and deliberate."
20098,"Critically invisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only",,by its effects.
20099,"If the word deliberate means anything ,",,it means to carefully consider or plan something.
20100,Both of them,,agreed to the plan.
20101,Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them,,as a novelty.
20102,"So as the years passed , I saw them each",,less and less.
20103,"`` What happened ,",,I don't know what happened.
20104,"I said , referring to the",,"book on the table, ""That's an interesting read."""
20105,"`` Evil , man , evil '' , he said ,",,his voice trembling with fear.
20106,About dawn he got,,up and started his day.
20107,The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and,,silence as the performer took the stage.
20108,"The last time I saw Dylan , his self-destruction",,was in full swing.
20109,It had assumed the terrifying,,form of a monstrous creature.
20110,Being with him was like being swept,,away by a powerful current.
20111,Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great,,"Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal in common, both being artists who pushed the boundaries of their respective forms and lived intense, often tumult"
20112,"As artists , they",,express their creativity through various mediums.
20113,"But this fluent , enchanting utterance had , compared with",,"the halting speech of his companion, a magical quality that captivated all who heard it."
20114,Neither of them got very far beyond a,,few steps.
20115,The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was the ambivalence of,,nature and humanity's place within it.
20116,Both of them did communicate one central theme : Against the ruin of,,"the world, love endures."
20117,"This , of course , is the theme",,of the story.
20118,"It is the theme of Horace , who certainly",,knew how to enjoy life's pleasures while also appreciating its transient nature.
20119,The difference is that Horace accepted his,,"limitations, while Virgil aspired to greatness."
20120,To Dylan and Bird it,,was clear that they needed to take a different approach.
20121,I do not believe that this is due to anything,,I do not believe that this is due to anything other than chance.
20122,I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world,,I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world events.
20123,Horace's column of imperishable verse shines quietly enough,,in the groves of literature.
20124,Art may have been for him the most enduring,,passion of his life.
20125,But the other activities of his,,were less well-known.
20126,They did not,,They did not
20127,Dylan Thomas's verse had to find endurance in,,the fierce and fertile mind.
20128,He was able to find meaning in his art as long,,as he remained true to his creative vision.
20129,As the world began to take on the guise of an immense air,,"travel terminal, people found themselves constantly on the move, navigating through a labyrinth of gates and checkpoints."
20130,Thomas and Parker have more in common,,than they realize.
20131,"In the practice of their art ,",,artists often push the boundaries of what is considered possible.
20132,"Contrary to popular belief , they",,are not afraid of the dark.
20133,Their effects are,,far-reaching and long-lasting.
20134,Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and,,innovative spirit of his predecessors.
20135,The tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a,,new scale or mode that differs from the traditional major and minor scales.
20136,"And there is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz , no matter how progressive",,", and traditional jazz than one might expect."
20137,This is true of the melodic line which could be put together,,with a series of notes that ascend or descend in pitch.
20138,This is exactly what happened in the,,This is exactly what happened in the town.
20139,It is the difference,,between night and day.
20140,It is not a farfetched analogy to say,,"that life is like a rollercoaster, with its ups and downs, twists and turns, and moments of both excitement and fear."
20141,The special syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith,,"Sitting at the edge of language, crafting verses that twist and turn, revealing the depths of the soul and the heights of imagination, are what make"
20142,"The metaphysical conceits , which fascinate the Reactionary Generation",,", are often rooted in a deep longing for a perceived lost order and a rejection of modernity's relentless progress."
20143,Thomas's ellipses and ambiguities,,leave room for interpretation.
20144,"The immediate theme , if it exists , is incidental , and",,the underlying message is what truly matters.
20145,This is one difference between Bird and,,Plane.
20146,"Again , contrary to popular belief , there is nothing",,"Again, contrary to popular belief, there is nothing inherently wrong with being alone."
20147,His sinuous melody is a sort,,"of liquid grace, flowing through the air like a river through a quiet valley."
20148,Emotionally it does not resemble,,anything familiar.
20149,This is true also of,,many other situations.
20150,"He may have been eccentric in his behavior ,",,but he was always brilliant in his work.
20151,Partly this difference is due to,,variations in individual circumstances and choices.
20152,The insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment,,can be both overwhelming and exhausting.
20153,It is much more,,difficult to maintain a healthy lifestyle in a sedentary job.
20154,Thomas certainly wanted to tell people about,,his new discovery.
20155,Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a,,new method for the old one.
20156,"In modern jazz , the saxophone is treated",,"as a versatile and expressive lead instrument, often featured in improvisational solos and complex harmonies."
20157,"Metrically , Thomas's verse was extremely conventional , as was , incidentally",,his use of rhyme and meter.
20158,I want to make clear what I consider the one,,most important aspect of this situation.
20159,Ornament is confabulation in,,architecture.
20160,"A poem by Dylan Thomas , a saxophone solo by Charles Parker , a",,"painting by Jackson Pollock, a novel by William Faulkner, a film by Orson Welles."
20161,Confabulation has come,,"to mean the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, often without the conscious intention to deceive."
20162,"Uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the sterile ,",,mechanical.
20163,Parker certainly had much,,to say about the matter.
20164,At one time it was the ambition of every saxophone player,,to join a big band.
20165,Even before his death this,,man was considered a legend in his field.
20166,The main line of development today goes,,towards artificial intelligence and machine learning.
20167,The point is that many of the most impressive,,achievements in history were accomplished through collaboration and perseverance.

20169,"Continuity exits , but like the neo-swing music developed from Lester",,"Young's innovative style, it has evolved and transformed over time."
20170,"In the plastic arts ,",,sculpture is a prominent form of expression.
20171,But it is obvious,,that the solution is clear.
20172,Nothing looks anything like an Ernst or,,a Pollock.
20173,Nothing looks less like their work,,than a copy of it.
20174,"Many of the post-World War 2 , abstract expressionists , apostles of the discipline",,were American artists who sought to convey emotion and individuality through non-representational forms.
20175,The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random,,can be surprisingly captivating.
20176,Once again what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation,,Once again what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation.
20177,the splashes of light and black which fake drapery,,create an illusion of depth and texture.
20178,Often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy -- the,,art of beautiful handwriting.
20179,"You have only to compare such painting with the work of , say",,Vincent van Gogh to see the difference.
20180,At its best the abstract expressionists,,created works that evoke powerful emotions and challenge traditional notions of art.
20181,"Its poverty shows up immediately when compared with Tiepolo , where",,its wealth is evident in the vibrant colors and grand scale of the artwork.
20182,"A Tiepolo painting , however confabulated , is",,still a masterpiece.

20184,"In fact , once the size is big enough to cover a",,"bed, it can also be used as a blanket."
20185,Now there is nothing,,left to do.
20186,There is just,,one way to solve this problem.
20187,"The great Ashikaga brush painters painted wallpapers ,",,"scrolls, and screens."
20188,A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of,,light and shadow.
20189,"So , in the last couple of years , abstract expressionism has",,gained a renewed interest among art enthusiasts and collectors.

20210,The form itself is stored in the next available,,slot.
20211,The address Af and the number of cells required to,,store it depends on the size of the address space and the data type of the cells.

20225,When the information cell for Af has been determined,,", the next step is to identify the corresponding data for Bf."
20226,Text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of,,characters or lines have been read.
20227,This initiates the second step of glossary lookup -- connecting the,,term with its definition.
20228,Each form represented by the dictionary is,,a unique entry with its own set of key-value pairs.
20229,"Each time a dictionary form matches a text form ,",,it is considered a correct match.

20274,"Forty-six states , including Rhode Island ,",,have adopted the Common Core State Standards.
20275,"In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority",,of them have already passed their budgets for the upcoming fiscal year.

20278,Pennsylvania closes its fiscal,,year on June 30.
20279,All of its cities close their,,gates at night.
20280,The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years,,that start and end at different times throughout the calendar year.

20283,He listed among the values,,"integrity, honesty, and respect."
20284,The uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances :,,ensuring consistent and transparent budgeting practices across all municipal departments.
20285,"The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule ,",,which is to align financial reporting periods with the calendar year or a specific 12-month cycle.
20286,It enables towns to make more economical purchases,,by pooling their resources and buying in bulk.
20287,The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful,,budgeting and financial planning.
20288,By fixing the tax rate in advance of,,"the fiscal year, the government aims to provide certainty and stability for taxpayers and budget planners."
20289,The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that,,of the state.
20290,This greatly simplifies the town's,,layout.
20291,The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money,,borrowed to cover temporary cash shortages.
20292,"Furthermore , tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in",,government securities or other low-risk financial instruments.
20293,The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town,,comparisons and budgeting processes.
20294,When towns have the same fiscal year it is,,easier to compare their financial statements and budgets.
20295,and as the cost of local government increases,,residents may face higher taxes or reduced services.
20296,Towns having different fiscal years,,can have varying budgets and financial planning cycles.
20297,"Of all advantages , probably none is more",,valuable than time.
20298,Borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a,,common practice in government finance.

20323,Plans vary from the `` talking stage '',,"to the ""action stage."""
20324,What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the,,value of preserving their historical and cultural heritage.
20325,An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state,,"reveals significant variations in timing and methods, impacting local budgets and financial planning."
20326,"However , it must be stressed that much depends upon",,the specific circumstances and context.

20337,The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal,,policy was challenging for the member states.
20338,Both would start their new,,lives afresh.

20341,Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform,,Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform schedule.
20342,The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years,,that end on June 30.
20343,All of these towns will require adjustments of,,some kind.
20344,"Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars ,",,the government must also consider the impact on various economic sectors and stakeholders.
20345,It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of,,"a new fiscal year must be carefully considered to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and operational requirements."
20346,In many communities there is simply,,not enough affordable housing.
20347,"it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful",,"it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods, careful monitoring, and consistent application."
20348,In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have,,led to significant cutbacks in public services and infrastructure maintenance.

20354,"The financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from",,a lack of proper budgeting and financial planning.
20355,This may be because the Athabascan,,people have a deep connection to their ancestral lands and traditional ways of life.
20356,or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much,,"wider area, from Alaska to the southwestern United States."

20359,The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is,,the variation in their numerical values.

20368,"( 4 ) verbs ( 9 ,",,"ran, jumped, laughed, played"
20369,This exception may be connected with Hoijer's use of a much higher,,sampling rate.
20370,Or the exception may be due to a,,rare genetic mutation.
20371,More word class ratios determined in more languages,,will provide a broader understanding of linguistic structures and patterns across different cultures.
20372,If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning,,then some word classes are more prone to changes in their stems while others remain relatively stable.
20373,Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several,,dialectal variations ).
20374,"The totals for these five categories are not too uneven ,",,so they can be compared fairly easily.

20379,If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in,,"the two sets, the correlation coefficient would be 1.0."
20380,If it were wholly random and,,"unpredictable, we would not be able to identify any patterns or make any predictions."
20381,"Thomas' findings are , first , `` that the individual items",,"in a collection can have unique characteristics and values, and second, that the overall collection itself can possess emergent properties not found in the individual items."""
20382,"but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying",,'' suggests a consistency in meaning across different contexts.
20383,"His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items",,", was that each item exhibits unique patterns and responses to stimuli."
20384,"His second conclusion , on semantic",,", was that meaning is context-dependent."

20390,But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established,,as a useful approach in linguistic analysis.

20696,This is the root issue for,,many of the problems we face today.
20697,We should not become confused or let our public become,,confused or let our public become misled by misinformation.
20698,There is no such,,thing as a free lunch.
20699,Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made,,the responsibility of the City Council.
20700,Thus there is a clearer division,,between the two concepts.
20701,"The board will be able to increase , decrease , add or",,remove members.
20702,but the City Council will now,,consider the proposal.
20703,Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence,,of a majority of the city council.

20712,Enlargement of the City Council and a new,,budget proposal are on the agenda for the next meeting.

20725,There is room for disagreement,,on this issue.
20726,But these are side issues,,that do not address the main problem.
20727,That theme cuts through hypocrisies,,and reveals truths.
20728,"It labels the slums , especially the Negro slums ,",,"as ""blighted"" areas."
20729,The villains of the piece are those who deny,,the truth and obstruct justice.
20730,These warnings must not,,be ignored.

20734,Letter writing is,,"a form of communication that involves composing a message to be sent to a recipient, often by mail."
20735,Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are,,kept as mementos or records of their correspondence.

20741,For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged,,by the neck until dead.

20743,Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections,,", they remained focused on the ongoing national political debates."
20744,The editor's main criticism of the trial was,,the lack of transparency and adherence to proper legal procedures.

20756,In contrast to,,"the bustling city, the countryside was serene and peaceful."

20763,The Newport Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a,,stir at the upcoming meeting than over the potential economic impacts of slavery's end.

20791,He had been carrying an Enfield rifle,,over his shoulder as he walked through the forest.
20792,A bayonet hung in,,the old armory.
20793,He was partially uniformed in,,his mismatched military attire.
20794,Mike stripped these from,,the tree.
20795,"He and Dean tied and gagged the man ,",,then left him in the abandoned warehouse.

20810,Light showed in the orderly,,room as the sun rose.
20811,Someone evidently was,,here recently.
20812,No doubt there would be,,challenges ahead.
20813,"About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade ,",,"including horses, cows, and sheep."

20820,Susan halted Dean,,in his tracks.
20821,"She clung to him , talking to",,"him, tears streaming down her face."
20822,He was thinking that the way she had responded to his,,proposal was unexpected and confusing.
20823,Dean turned from Susan and took,,a deep breath.
20824,"He kissed her also ,",,"and she blushed, feeling her heart race."
20825,He released her,,and she walked away.

20844,The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade,,", his eyes scanning the perimeter for any sign of trouble."
20845,Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the,,man noticed him.
20846,Mike struck with the,,hammer.
20847,But the luck that had been,,on their side finally ran out.
20848,The guard instinctively parried the,,blow with his shield.
20849,He tried to veer the rifle,,away from the target.
20850,"Mike , off balance , managed to bat",,the ball away.
20851,Mike swung the pistol,,and aimed it at the target.
20852,This time it connected solidly on,,his jaw.
20853,The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the,,"canyon, echoing through the narrow passageways."
20854,The startled horses began,,to gallop away.

20860,Mike took the bayonet from Dean's,,hand.
20861,`` Up you go,,"`` Up you go, little one. ``"
20862,Dean resisted Mike's attempt to,,take the book from him.
20863,`` Why not you,,"""Why not you?"""
20864,The rest of us can fort up in the,,castle.
20865,You're the one that's taking,,the risk.
20866,"Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily",,and set him on the horse.
20867,`` No telling how good this,,could be.
20868,`` Favor him and save something,,for a rainy day.

20870,"We'll still have the rifle , and I",,can use it to protect us.
20871,I'll stampede the rest of these horses,,if you get in my way.
20872,Dean leaned from the saddle and gave,,the horse a gentle pat on the neck.
20873,"`` McLish '' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion ,",,"""we need to move faster if we want to make it before nightfall."""

20882,`` They're stealin' the,,`` They're stealin' the show.``
20883,He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed,,the narrow path that led to the hidden entrance.
20884,His shout had been,,so loud that it echoed through the empty halls.
20885,The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through,,the abandoned barracks.
20886,"All were carrying guns they had seized up ,",,from the armory.
20887,Durkin and Calhoun came,,to an agreement.
20888,They had pistols,,but they didn't know how to use them.
20889,They bawled questions that were,,unanswerable.
20890,They followed the others,,into the dark forest.
20891,Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of,,"the attackers charged forward, their boots kicking up dust in the dry grass."
20892,Mike made a dash to the,,store before it closed.
20893,He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood,,side by side in the dusty clearing.
20894,Mike crawled to the,,"edge of the cliff, his heart pounding with fear and adrenaline."
20895,The orderly room seemed,,empty and quiet.
20896,A lantern hung from a,,tree branch.
20897,"Ducking inside , he found that three",,"Ducking inside, he found that three"
20898,"A brace of pistols , holstered on belts ,",,hung at their hips.
20899,"An ammunition case stood open ,",,revealing a supply of bullets and grenades.
20900,"Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the",,"floor, and laid down to rest."
20901,Shouldering the load he,,continued on his journey.
20902,His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute,,", but the damage was extensive."
20903,He looked at the looming hoods of the,,approaching cars.
20904,"Snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered",,it against the stone floor.
20905,He picked up the powder,,and carefully measured it out.
20906,"Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest",,cannon.
20907,"He shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and",,eyed the horizon warily.
20908,He turned and raced across the,,"field, his heart pounding in his chest."
20909,Powder flame gushed,,from the ruptured canister.
20910,The stockade was brilliantly lighted,,by a series of torches placed around its perimeter.
20911,Bullets began to,,fly.
20912,One struck the muzzle of one of the,,guns with a rock.
20913,"Its force spun him around , but",,he managed to keep his footing.
20914,A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot,,"and he stumbled, falling to the ground."
20915,Another struck him heavily in the,,chest.
20916,Susan and Julia came from the,,same town.
20917,The three of them floundered through the door,,", their movements awkward and uncoordinated."
20918,Susan bounced to her feet,,and rushed out of the room.
20919,She crouched aside as bullets beat at,,the wall like hailstones.
20920,Some tore entirely through,,the fabric.
20921,"The iron hinges held , but the planks were",,rotten.
20922,"Mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around",,"the waist, and pulled her close."
20923,"He hovered over her to shield her , for",,he wanted to protect her from the rain.
20924,Guerrillas were only a dozen yards,,away when the ambush was sprung.
20925,Mike snatched a pistol from the,,drawer and pointed it at the intruder.
20926,He dropped a man,,He dropped a man off at the airport.
20927,At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle,,"and the bullet whizzed past, narrowly missing its target."
20928,The mudwagon had,,been stuck in the mire for hours.
20929,The blaze was spreading,,rapidly through the dry underbrush.
20930,The guerrillas realized they,,needed to change their tactics to gain the upper hand.
20931,`` There goes our grub,,`` There goes our food. ``
20932,`` Get a bucket line,,and we'll start filling it up.
20933,The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails,,to carry water from the nearby stream.
20934,But what few containers,,"But what few containers there were, were filled to the brim."
20935,"Many of them , in increasing panic , came running",,to the shelter.
20936,The heat drove,,the people indoors.
20937,The roof of the command,,center was damaged in the storm.
20938,`` Drag the wagons to,,the loading area.```
20939,`` Run 'em right into,,the ground.
20940,One of the wagons erupted,,in a burst of flames.
20941,A sizable supply of powder,,was stored in the old stone building at the edge of town.
20942,The wagons and the coach were beyond,,repair.
20943,The glow of the fire reached through the openings in,,"the dark, dense forest."
20944,"The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting",,"a deep, painful wound."
20945,But it had missed the bone,,and only grazed the skin.
20946,Susan and Julia ripped strips from,,the old curtains to make a rug.
20947,Mike tested the leg and found that he,,"could still walk, but it was painful."
20948,Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly,,inexhaustible source of heroic tales and moral lessons.
20949,Nothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith,,", I have never wandered far or faced such trials."
20950,"the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself",,as Homer.
20951,That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The,,Odyssey is widely accepted by scholars.
20952,Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment : Beowulf and,,Grendel's conflict is more than a mere battle between good and evil; it is a struggle that reflects the complexities of heroism and monst
20953,The Anglo-Saxon alliterative line and the Homeric hexameter,,are both examples of early poetic forms that utilize specific metrical patterns and sound devices to enhance the oral delivery and memorability of the verses.
20954,Yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary,,for the successful completion of the task.
20955,The poet in a written tradition who generally never blots a line,,is said to have a flawless and effortless style.
20956,But the oral poet,,"remains a vital link to our cultural heritage, preserving stories and traditions through the power of spoken word."
20957,he must improvise continuously,,to adapt to the ever-changing circumstances.
20958,"The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings ,",,which were metaphorical expressions used to enrich the language and imagery of their poetry.
20959,"the Homeric poet had epithets , which",,"were used to describe characters, places, and things in a repetitive manner, often highlighting a particular quality or attribute."
20960,The quest of the historical Homer is likely,,to remain unresolved due to the limited and ambiguous evidence available.
20961,no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey,,is credited to a single author.
20962,This observation is of interest not only to students of,,"history but also to those studying sociology, anthropology, and political science."
20963,This observation too may have,,been influenced by external factors.
20964,"To the extent that a language is formulaic , its individual",,expressions can be predictable and repetitive.
20965,It is false to be certain of having discovered in,,It is false to be certain of having discovered in any field all there is to know.
20966,"Yet , if the argument is turned awry , there may",,be unintended consequences.
20967,A formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely,,because it is familiar or repetitive.
20968,"Time-servers , though the periphrastic expressions are , they",,"Time-servers, though the periphrastic expressions are many, they"
20969,Nouns and adjectives in a written tradition,,often follow specific grammatical rules and patterns.
20970,in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire,,community or group.
20971,Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the,,accuracy of the information provided.
20972,no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable,,signs of extraterrestrial life.
20973,A ship at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked,,beast.
20974,Even when defenseless of weapons the Danes would be Gar-Dene (,,"Even when defenseless of weapons the Danes would be Gar-Dene, a term that signified their fierce and unyielding spirit."
20975,"Achilles , like Siegfried in The Nibelungenlied , is potentially the swiftest of",,"all warriors, but his speed is matched by his temper and pride."
20976,The epic language was not entirely the,,same as the spoken language of the people.
20977,The poet's intentions are difficult to discern and,,the meaning of the poem remains elusive.
20978,"the language , however , is a proper object of scrutiny ,",,"and its structures, meanings, and uses can reveal much about human cognition and social interaction."
20979,Beowulf and the Homeric,,"epics share themes of heroism, honor, and the struggle against fate."
20980,at some stage in their,,"lives, they"
20981,"If Cynewulf was literate , the Beowulf poet may have been also ,",,"If Cynewulf was literate, the Beowulf poet may have been also."
20982,The account of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests,,on a combination of oral tradition and written records.
20983,Thus one line in five from The Iliad and The Odyssey,,is attributed to Homer.
20984,"The ratio is thoroughly remarkable , because the lines are so",,precisely aligned.
20985,Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no,,rhyme scheme.

20987,The closest scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon,,legal system.
20988,if any words or phrases are,,"missing, please let me know."
20989,The Iliad has two words for,,wrath and honor.
20990,Maude's long nose,,resembled a small carrot.

21491,"The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially",,", enjoyed a good reputation among the parishioners for his engaging sermons and community involvement."

21535,He met nobody he,,could recognize.
21536,There is no accounting of his movements in this long,,period.
21537,Bridget's testimony was,,crucial to the case.
21538,She said it was after she returned from her,,trip that everything changed.
21539,This was long after Morse,,had invented the telegraph.
21540,Morse's knowledge of,,telegraphy was extensive and detailed.
21541,"He knew the house fairly well , he had been there on",,several occasions.
21542,And despite Knowlton's attempts to show that the house was locked,,", the evidence suggested otherwise."
21543,The screen door was unlocked for some ten or,,fifteen minutes before someone noticed.

21545,Morse could have returned openly while Bridget was sick in the,,hospital.
21546,He had been to the farm the previous day and he could,,still remember the smell of the fresh hay and the sound of the animals.
21547,He could have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and,,arrived at the train station by dawn.
21548,If he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return,,he would have arrived home before 12:00.
21549,"With Lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs in her",,"room, everything seemed peaceful."
21550,"With the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the",,"body, and disappeared into the night."
21551,There was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains,,or other evidence.

21553,The motive may have been,,revenge.
21554,there was no financial gain,,in the transaction.
21555,On the other side of the ledger is the fact that he,,has a strong track record of success in his field.

21740,The death of a man is unique,,in its finality and impact on those left behind.

21742,But how can one figure,,out the solution to such a complex problem?
21743,Christianity declares that in the life and death of,,"Jesus Christ, the son of God, salvation is made available to all who believe in him."

21764,Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for,,Adam.
21765,"therefore there is no need for him , as there is",,no shortage of others who can do the job.
21766,Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence of,,chance or necessity.

21772,"Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it",,clear that his views were more nuanced than previously thought.
21773,He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude,,He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude entirely.
21774,"for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly",,mortal.
21775,Therefore Irenaeus describes man's,,"nature as a composite of body, soul, and spirit."
21776,"but if he did not , he would become mortal ,",,and his immortality would be lost forever.
21777,"These conditions man did not keep ,",,and so he suffered the consequences.

21779,"Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil's",,deception led to his downfall.
21780,"He was , in the words of Irenaeus , ``",,the disciple whom Jesus loved. ''
21781,The true way to immortality lay through obedience,,to the divine will.
21782,for she did not obey when,,she was told to stay behind.
21783,His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him,,to reconsider the entire process.
21784,That parallelism affects his picture of,,reality.
21785,At the nadir of,,"his career, he felt utterly hopeless and alone."
21786,`` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power,,of the serpent.```

21789,he sees a parallel also to the,,situation in his own life.
21790,"In any case , though they had been promised immortality if",,they remained faithful to their cause.
21791,The wages of,,sin is death.
21792,"Man's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with",,"God, is now marred by sin and separation."
21793,"Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral",,never loses its elegance and grace.
21794,"Even death , therefore , has a",,price.
21795,"This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian ,",,is reflected in their writings.

21797,"As man can live only by dying , so it was",,"As man can live only by dying, so it was that he found his true purpose in the moments before his end."
21798,It is probably fair to say that the idea of death,,is universal and inevitable.
21799,This applies to his,,situation as well.
21800,It is borne out also by the absence of any developed,,It is borne out also by the absence of any developed infrastructure.
21801,This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem,,shifts the focus of theological discourse and practice towards the redemption and transformation of human existence in the face of mortality.
21802,"Death reminds man of his sin , but",,eternity offers hope of redemption.
21803,"It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also",,serves as a reminder of the consequences of his actions.
21804,These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated,,the physical and the emotional.
21805,The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence,,of sin have often been challenged by alternative theological perspectives that emphasize the naturalness of death within the created order.
21806,"If it was , then it must have been God's intention",,"If it was, then it must have been God's intention."
21807,"One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen",,"into a deep sleep, and from his rib, Eve would have been created."

21809,"On the other hand , Christian faith knows that death",,"is not the end, but a passage to eternal life."
21810,"It is the wages of sin ,",,but the gift of God is eternal life.

21814,The preconditions of sociology have remained,,unchanged.
21815,"Like primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological",,system is built upon fundamental values that are considered basic and irreducible.

21817,Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can,,be given to the world?
21818,(,,)
21819,) Here I think the role,,of the facilitator is to guide the discussion.
21820,The simple pragmatic success of the sociology,,lies in its ability to provide practical solutions to social problems.
21821,The mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology,,reveals the deep-seated biases and assumptions that shape our understanding of social structures.
21822,A parallel function for philosophy is the study of the,,"nature of reality and existence, including questions about knowledge, ethics, and the meaning of life."
21823,Philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning,,only if it is grounded in a coherent theory of language and reality.
21824,This involves a sifting of the empirical and,,theoretical evidence.

21828,The purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is,,to understand the fundamental nature of society and social behavior.
21829,Such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its Platonic form,,"Such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its Platonic form by rejecting the existence of abstract, eternal forms or ideas that are the ultimate reality"
21830,"But contrary to Whitehead , philosophy",,is not merely a series of footnotes to Plato.
21831,The uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest,,"in its ability to clarify concepts, resolve contradictions, and provide a framework for coherent reasoning."
21832,"However , when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences , to dictate",,"to them what their content and methods should be, it oversteps its bounds and risks becoming dogmatic and unproductive."

21837,"Science is mocked for wishing to know nothing of Nothing , in a",,world where ignorance is often celebrated.
21838,It is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics,,but rather the shift towards empirical and scientific approaches in philosophy.
21839,It is simply revealing the state to which,,it has been reduced.
21840,Consider the traditional `` four fields '' of philosophy,,"Consider the traditional ""four fields"" of philosophy: metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and logic."
21841,"In this situation , philosophy has survived by separating itself from metaphysics",,"and focusing on areas such as ethics, epistemology, and logic."
21842,"In this connection , it might be noted that the theory of games",,"has been applied to a wide range of disciplines, including economics, political science, and biology."
21843,"This does not mean that philosophy resolves the problems it generates , any",,more than science resolves the questions it raises.
21844,But the forceful presentation of new issues for the,,public to consider can sometimes lead to significant societal changes.
21845,To those raised on Marcel's Homo Viator and Heidegger's das,,"Man, Sartre's emphasis on radical freedom and the responsibility of choice might seem both liberating and daunting."
21846,"However , modesty and",,humility are virtues that can lead to greater respect and admiration from others.
21847,Philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as,,"a handmaiden, subordinate and supportive, rather than an independent discipline."
21848,The ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has traversed,,is a testament to our unyielding curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
21849,Philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content by noting,,that there is always more to understand and question in the pursuit of knowledge.
21850,"The realm of science , whatever the degree of precision",,", is always expanding and evolving."
21851,") Whatever philosophy is conceived to be , its rationalist , logistic attitude",,is fundamentally opposed to mysticism and emotionalism.

21856,"In this , philosophy and",,science often intersect.
21857,The hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of analytical and synthetic,,remains distinct and unbreached.
21858,for this division is but an abstract representation,,of a more complex reality.

21867,Does society really exist as an entity over,,"and above individuals, or is it merely a construct of human thought and interaction?"

21872,It is rather that introducing them into social analysis reflects,,a shift in understanding complex societal dynamics.
21873,"An operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty , since it",,"deals with complex, dynamic social phenomena that are subject to change and interpretation."
21874,A philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its,,own limitations.

22113,These hard-surface cleaners are,,"designed to remove dirt, grime, and stains from various surfaces."
22114,Cleaning or detergent action is,,"the process of removing dirt, stains, and impurities from surfaces or materials using chemical agents."
22115,"Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate ,",,and a surfactant to remove contaminants.
22116,An oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies,,"in the type of material being cleaned; soft surfaces like fabrics and carpets require gentle, often water-based cleaners, while hard surfaces such as tile and wood"

22120,Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and showed,,that the device could effectively identify contaminants and measure the cleanliness of metal surfaces after various cleaning processes.
22121,There are considerable differences between the,,two versions of the story.
22122,"Exclusive of esthetic values , such as high-",,"quality craftsmanship, durability, and functionality, are also important factors to consider."
22123,"No matter how they are formulated , a large number of organic actives are simply",,not stable or effective over time.
22124,This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which,,the effectiveness of different detergents can be compared.
22125,A good formulation will keep the clothes clean,,and prevent stains from setting in.
22126,"Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number",,of alternative methods have been developed to reduce costs and time.
22127,Also given are several laboratory,,Also given are several laboratory procedures.
22128,Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing,,the soil samples and analyzing the sediment that remains.
22129,"As is the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders",,are also crucial for enhancing the cleaning performance of detergents.
22130,The problems of hard-surface cleaning,,"include stubborn stains, buildup of dirt and grime, and the need for strong chemicals that may be harmful to the environment or human health."
22131,"In hard-surface cleaning , the inorganic salts",,are used to enhance the cleaning efficiency and help in the removal of stubborn stains.
22132,"Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and",,silicates are common anions in water treatment processes.
22133,"In addition , the polyphosphates are also used ,",,as water softeners in detergents and cleaning products.
22134,The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning,,"lies in their ability to enhance the cleaning efficiency, remove tough stains, and prevent the buildup of mineral deposits."
22135,"The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which",,are present on surfaces or materials.
22136,"Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic",,", can include substances such as sand, silt, and clay."
22137,"Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats",,", require specialized cleaning methods to effectively remove contaminants."

22139,"Miscellaneous soils , which primarily include sticky substances and",," Miscellaneous soils, which primarily include sticky substances and clay, can pose significant challenges in construction and agriculture due to their unique properties."
22140,The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically,,removed by scrubbing or washing.
22141,"However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between",,opposite charges.
22142,This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to,,experience an attractive force towards regions of higher electric field intensity.
22143,"In addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by",,static electricity or mechanical interlocking.
22144,"Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils",,can be removed with a variety of cleaning agents and techniques.
22145,"In most cases , these soils are",,well-drained and fertile.
22146,Greasy soils are hardly removed by,,water alone.
22147,"and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium",,"and magnesium salts, as well as various organic and inorganic compounds."
22148,The detergent active is that substance which,,cleans by removing dirt and grease from surfaces.
22149,The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in,,"soil suspension, preventing dirt from resettling on fabrics."
22150,( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration,,the surfactant molecules remain as individual entities in solution.
22151,Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so,,they are effective in solubilizing oils and other hydrophobic compounds.
22152,"Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show",,a strong correlation between the two variables.
22153,"In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated",,"with a surfactant layer, making them easier to remove."
22154,Substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed,,by soils and sediments.
22155,"This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially",,those with multiple positive or negative charges.
22156,The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the,,same charged surface.
22157,The negatively charged dirt particles then leave the,,fabric surface.

22538,Most of us would be willing,,to help a friend in need.

22540,There is one thing,,that I can always count on.
22541,a person will never have spiritual poise and inner,,peace without self-reflection and mindfulness.

22548,Forgiveness is the door through which a person,,can walk into a new chapter of peace and understanding.
22549,You cannot wear the banner of God and at the same,,time bear the mark of the beast.
22550,"Henry Van Dyke said , `` Forgive",,"your enemies, but never forget their names. ''"
22551,Jesus made three things,,"water into wine, the blind see, and the dead rise."
22552,"We must , first of all , be willing",,to listen.
22553,It will do no good to seek God's forgiveness until,,you have made amends for your wrongdoings.
22554,"Then , Jesus indicated that",,he would be betrayed by one of his disciples.
22555,In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we,,"say, ""Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."""
22556,When a person meets God's requirements for,,"salvation, they are considered righteous in His eyes."
22557,God's mercy and patience,,are boundless and extend to all who seek them.
22558,Forgiveness implies more than a person wanting,,to let go of resentment or anger towards someone who has wronged them; it also involves a willingness to understand and empathize with the other person's
22559,It also implies that a man wants his future,,to be successful and fulfilling.
22560,"We want the past forgiven , but at the same time",,we fear the future forgotten.

22606,We expect bestowal of,,favors upon those who have shown merit.
22607,But how little love,,there is in the world.
22608,The church truly is not a rest home,,for the spiritually complacent.
22609,It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less,,concerned with the practical applications of their theories than with the theories themselves.
22610,No single explanation is adequate,,to account for the complexity of human behavior.
22611,"Improvement , however , is urgent , and",,we must act now to address the issues at hand.
22612,The first is a wide-ranging,,overview of the topic.
22613,Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of,,linguistic theories and concepts.
22614,An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of,,the topic and is well-versed in its complexities.
22615,"By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of",,languages and their structures than the tip of the iceberg.
22616,This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena,,can lead to oversight and misunderstanding.
22617,Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more,,sophisticated and context-aware approach is developed.
22618,"Papers like these four , if widely read ,",,could significantly influence public opinion.
22619,The second need is,,safety.
22620,"The result has been neglect ,",,and the consequences are dire.
22621,"As these maladies overlap ,",,it can be difficult to diagnose the specific cause.
22622,Analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions,,and provide a more nuanced understanding of the issues at hand.
22623,They will give suggestions that can,,help improve the situation.
22624,Good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better,,data collection but also enhance their ability to analyze and interpret linguistic phenomena accurately.
22625,"Actually , none of these papers",,"Actually, none of these papers are relevant to the topic."
22626,But it is worth pondering that very little has been,,done to address the root causes of the problem.
22627,"These things have been disseminated by other means , but",,they have not been as widely or effectively spread as they are now.
22628,The third need is,,safety and security.
22629,We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for,,the analysis of spoken language as it is for the analysis of written language.
22630,One issue that must be faced is the,,growing income inequality.
22631,"Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems ,",,they are often more stable and less likely to change over time.
22632,Actual practice does not often,,match theoretical expectations.
22633,Tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would,,suggest.
22634,Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters,,that are primarily pitch-related.
22635,This may both divert the attention of the,,audience and dilute the impact of your main message.
22636,The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features,,from the cognitive processes they represent.
22637,"Of course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of",,the economy as well.
22638,But in general the individual variation is a small,,But in general the individual variation is a small fraction of the overall pattern.
22639,"With tone , individual differences may be greater than",,the average effect of the tone itself.
22640,"Pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional",,"state to another, can be quite noticeable."
22641,A second explanation is suggested by,,the alternative hypothesis.
22642,Tone and intonation often,,convey more meaning than words alone.
22643,Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the,,theoretical from the practical aspects.
22644,Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact,,in complex ways to influence speech production and perception.
22645,"for example , duration sometimes figures in",,the calculation of interest on a loan.
22646,"Some phonetic features , for example glottal catch or murmur , are",,not universally present in all languages.
22647,But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to,,master as Chinese and Arabic.
22648,"This explanation of tone difficulties , however",,", does not fully capture the complexity of the issue."
22649,In some ( the Ewe type mentioned above ) interaction of,,In some (the Ewe type mentioned above) interaction of
22650,"In many of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and",,"in others, it can significantly alter the meaning."
22651,"Still , even in such languages tone analysis has",,its challenges and complexities.
22652,A third explanation is suggested by,,the possibility that...
22653,There we see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed,,in a complex network of allophonic variation and distribution.
22654,"In the `` typical tone language '' , tonal morphophonemics",,involves changes in pitch that can alter the meaning of words or grammatical elements.
22655,The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic,,processes vary significantly across languages.
22656,"The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly",,consists of only two or three contrasts.
22657,Consonantal systems are not merely,,"a collection of sounds, but also involve complex patterns and rules."
22658,Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as,,the guidelines that determine how morphemes are realized phonetically in different contexts.
22659,"The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous ,",,and each language exploits a different subset of these possibilities.
22660,Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic,,similarity.
22661,"Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can",,involve changes in pitch or tone to distinguish meaning.
22662,"The possibilities are few , and the total",,is limited.
22663,"Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect",,", leading to redundancy and confusion."
22664,Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal,,alternations.
22665,The statement of the system,,is as follows:
22666,Smaller systems can of course,,be more efficient and easier to manage.
22667,A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics,,"A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics, but it may not fully capture the complexities of sound patterns in a language."
22668,The design of orthographies has received much less,,attention than the study of spoken language.
22669,Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to,,"the issue, but she has dedicated her career to studying it in depth."
22670,Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses,,that are beyond the scope of this discussion.
22671,Many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most,,superficial differences.
22672,Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes,,have held similar prejudices.
22673,"As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography",,is an arbitrary and often illogical system.
22674,His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it,,can make.
22675,"To do so , he finds it necessary to examine",,the underlying causes and effects.
22676,"In the process , he develops some very significant observations",,about the nature of human behavior and societal structures.
22677,A few of his examples are of very great interest,,and provide valuable insights into the topic.
22678,His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on,,the grounds that spelling should reflect pronunciation.
22679,Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in,,his mind carefully.
22680,I hope his suggestions are given the,,consideration they deserve.
22681,"This , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they",,will continue to serve in various essential roles.
22682,We need many more studies of this sort if the design,,is to be fully understood and optimized.
22683,One other paper deals with a phonologic problem,,"in a specific language, examining the patterns and rules that govern sound production and perception."
22684,This restates the already widely known,,fact.
22685,As a restatement it makes only a,,slight difference.
22686,But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic,,analysis of poetry.
22687,It does show one feature of the,,landscape that is particularly striking.
22688,"But it does not , as it claims , demonstrate",,that the theory is correct.
22689,It seems to me that,,the situation is more complicated than it appears.

23077,It is the story of the hopeless love of,,a young man for a woman who could never be his.
23078,There are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly,,"to the rhythm of an unseen force, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and determination."
23079,The child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his,,friends to start a secret club.
23080,The story ends in the child's illness and delirium brought on by,,the harsh winter and lack of proper care.
23081,The child dies with his,,mother's name on his lips.
23082,I had read the story many times without asking myself,,why it always ended the same way.
23083,But on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy,,I was struck by his vivid imagination and the innocence with which he spoke about it.
23084,Why does the story,,end so abruptly?
23085,How does the rocking exert its uncanny,,"influence on the mind, soothing yet unsettling?"
23086,"The rocking is actually felt in the story ,",,but it's subtle and adds to the atmosphere.
23087,The rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the,,baby asleep while also providing a soothing motion for the caregiver.
23088,it conceals and yet,,it reveals
23089,And if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can,,interpret the motion as a representation of intimate connection and desire.
23090,For this love of the boy for his mother is,,a deep and abiding affection that shapes his life.
23091,This love belongs to,,you and me.
23092,We have so completely entered the child's fantasy that his illness,,seems almost like a part of the game.
23093,I am sure that none of the effects of this story were,,unintended.
23094,It is most probable that Freud and the Oedipus complex,,are closely associated in the field of psychoanalysis.
23095,"He was simply writing a story that wanted to be told ,",,and he couldn't ignore the words that flowed through his mind.

23100,He borrows the insights of psychology to improve his impaired vision but cannot,,see the underlying emotional issues that affect his perception.
23101,He has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious,,"and now wanders in a dreamlike state, entranced by its mysteries."
23102,I have argued that Oedipus of the Oedipus complex has,,"been misinterpreted as a symbol of unconscious desires and conflicts, rather than a tragic figure caught in circumstances beyond his control."
23103,"Moral dread is seen as the other face of desire , and here psychoanalysis",,offers insights into how unconscious conflicts and repressed wishes manifest as fear or anxiety.
23104,There is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest,,"There is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories are from ancient mythology, involving gods and goddesses who were also siblings."

23106,the oracle speaks false and,,true at the same time.
23107,the heroic act is the,,crowning moment of their journey.
23108,Thomas Mann wrote The,,Magic Mountain.
23109,But The Holy Sinner is not simply a retelling,,of a familiar tale; it offers a unique perspective and intricate narrative that sets it apart.
23110,And when he retold the legend of Gregorius he interpolated a modern version,,that aligned with current beliefs and values.
23111,Grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a,,sibling and a parent.
23112,He is born in secrecy after the death of,,his predecessor.
23113,The infant is discovered by a fisherman,,in a basket floating on the river.
23114,"Grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and",,sets out to find his true identity.
23115,Sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed,,in the old oak chest in the attic.

23117,At the end of this period two pious Christians in Rome receive the,,relics of the saints and bury them with honor.
23118,Grigorss comes to Rome and becomes,,a renowned gladiator.
23119,In the last pages of the book Sibylla comes to Rome to,,seek revenge on those who wronged her.
23120,It is from this unpromising background that,,she emerged as a leading figure in her field.
23121,The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart,,in that he often relies on supernatural elements and mythological creatures to solve his cases.
23122,"On the one hand , he does not work for",,"the company anymore, but on the other hand, he still feels a strong connection to his former colleagues."
23123,"As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is",,often hired to solve mysterious cases.

23128,"Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name ,",,he took it upon himself to maintain order in the community.
23129,Thus the fictional detective is much,,more intriguing and complex than a real one.
23130,"He is , first and foremost , a defender",,of the faith.
23131,It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service,,that defines the spirit of the American West.
23132,"In this way , the private detective",,was able to gather the necessary evidence without being detected.
23133,He is an individualist but,,he values the importance of community.
23134,he is a public servant,,who works for the government.
23135,"In the mystery story , as in The Wealth of Nations , individualism",,is both a driving force and a source of conflict.

23138,The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe,,"led to increased economic power and influence, shaping industries and markets across the continent."

23141,Driven from the marketplace by the course of history,,", the once dominant industry now stands as a relic of a bygone era."
23142,The birth of the myth compensates,,for the death of God.
23143,"Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which",,arise from the narrative's attempt to reconcile its disparate elements are difficult to ignore.
23144,The private eye is therefore,,the only one who can unravel the mystery.
23145,but his morality rests upon,,a foundation of personal principles and values.
23146,The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between,,guilt and innocence is central to the plot.
23147,"Unfortunately , this assumption does",,not hold true in all cases.

23163,These little problems help me,,stay focused and productive throughout the day.
23164,"Holmes is a public servant ,",,dedicated to solving crimes and serving justice.
23165,but the society which he,,lives in is constantly changing.
23166,The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard provides an,,"interesting dynamic in the stories, often showcasing a mix of respect, frustration, and mutual reliance."
23167,"Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard , Holmes",,remains a private detective at heart.
23168,They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too ``,,unpredictable.
23169,Why do the police find Holmes,,to be a valuable ally in solving complex cases?
23170,"On the face of it , it is because",,it appears that way.
23171,"Another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by Watson when he",,"mentions the peculiar behavior of the client, suggesting a deeper, more complex motive behind the case."
23172,Watson's insight is verified by the mysterious link,,between the crime scene and the suspect's past.
23173,The two men resemble each other closely in,,appearance and mannerisms.
23174,The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes,,falling to his apparent death at the Reichenbach Falls.
23175,They are presumed to have plunged to,,their deaths.

23184,"Like Holmes , the American private eye",,is known for his keen observational skills and ability to solve complex cases.
23185,"But unlike Holmes , he feels his society",,is flawed and seeks to change it.
23186,"Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private",,"detective navigated the city's underbelly with a cynical edge, solving cases that the police couldn't or wouldn't touch."
23187,His alienation is far more,,deeply rooted than anyone realizes.
23188,he is not an eccentric,,he is quite normal
23189,"With Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe , alienation",,"is a recurring theme, often explored through the detective's reclusive and eccentric nature."
23190,"Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends",,"his days reading, writing, and tending to his vast collection of indoor plants."
23191,"More profound and more disturbing , however , is",,the underlying cause of the issue.

23193,His tough honesty condemns him to,,a life of solitude.

23195,"In the end , he gets his man ,",,and justice is served.
23196,virtue is its own,,reward.
23197,Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search,,of a legendary treasure hidden deep in the jungle.
23198,but when the bird is found at last,,it sings a song of relief and joy.
23199,Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on,,his former accomplices.
23200,"For Sam Spade , neither crime",,nor punishment existed in a vacuum.
23201,"moreover , it is increasingly difficult",,to maintain privacy in the digital age.
23202,Because the private eye intends to save society in spite of,,"the risks and dangers he faces, he remains relentless in his pursuit of the truth."

23207,Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest provides a,,gripping narrative of corruption and violence in a small town.
23208,"But even when the police are honest ,",,they may still make mistakes.
23209,"He is , like Phillip Marlowe",,a private detective with a sharp wit and a knack for solving complex cases.
23210,"Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police",,"is portrayed as a complex dance of suspicion, rivalry, and occasional cooperation."
23211,"In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find",,the real culprit.
23212,It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service,,that poses a significant challenge to modern society.
23213,"By upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed",,himself at odds with the law.
23214,That society responds by condemning the private eye as a,,violation of personal privacy and ethical boundaries.
23215,"If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he",,"will continue to act with integrity and adhere to his moral code, regardless of external pressures or influences."
23216,"He must , in short , cease to",,be.
23217,"On the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen",,"path, he must be prepared to face the challenges that come with it."
23218,Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to,,write fiction altogether.
23219,His successors have adopted,,his policies.
23220,"In order to save the mystery story , they",,had to uncover the truth before it was too late.
23221,The first of two possible variations on this,,theme involves a subtle change in the melody.
23222,"At first glance , this hero seems to be more rather",,"than a conventional one, with his complex motives and flawed character."
23223,"For Hammer ,",,every nail is an opportunity.
23224,"He kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them",,and leaves no trace behind.
23225,Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed,,great emphasis on the importance of context.

23235,It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity,,in favor of a more progressive agenda.
23236,That is to say Gabriel's fundamental law had been so much modified,,by subsequent developments that it barely resembled its original form.

23247,"And by the time the war ended ,",,the city was in ruins.
23248,We of the liberal-led world got,,used to the idea that democracy and human rights would continue to spread globally.
23249,During the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal,,"will focus on expanding access to healthcare, improving education, and supporting small businesses."
23250,"In 1952 , it will",,be the first year that Queen Elizabeth II reigns.
23251,"All of this , I know ,",,but some things are better left unsaid.
23252,But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of,,a lifetime.
23253,"A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the",,"following way: ""The truth is often hidden in plain sight, waiting for someone with the right perspective to uncover it."""
23254,"The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for",,it was lukewarm at best.
23255,Lubell offers his book as an explanation,,of the complexities and nuances of political behavior and party systems.
23256,I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing,,challenges we face.
23257,"It has moved on various levels ,",,from physical relocation to emotional growth.
23258,Obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism,,means.
23259,"For it was neglected , not to",,"For it was neglected, not to be used."
23260,I would agree,,with that statement.
23261,But I'm not here,,to stay.
23262,"Though , to be sure , we gave Kennedy no",,reason to doubt our commitment.
23263,"This is , however ,",,not the case.
23264,But before I try to diagnose it,,I want to gather more information about your symptoms.
23265,I will mention two volumes of specific comment,,I will mention two volumes of specific commentary.
23266,"The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by",,private investors.
23267,What I want to point out here is that all of them,,are not the same.
23268,I suppose we might classify Billy,,as a troublemaker.
23269,And I would further note that they all -- with one exception,,And I would further note that they all -- with one exception -- share a common trait.
23270,Its refrain was : `` let us return to the,,good old days. ''
23271,Adlai Stevenson expressed some,,doubts about the feasibility of the plan.
23272,Others invoked technology,,to enhance their capabilities.
23273,Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of,,the social and political forms through which we have been accustomed to organize our lives.''
23274,But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals,,is how quickly they abandoned their former principles.
23275,The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower's,,conversation with Montgomery about the importance of air superiority.
23276,The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the unconscious liberal,,bias.
23277,This group is secularist and their,,beliefs are rooted in the separation of religion from state affairs.
23278,But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I,,find both challenging and essential.
23279,"And let me add Murray's new book as another symptom of it , particularly so",,because it aligns with the prevailing trends in contemporary literature.
23280,"Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence , too",,", referencing its principles of liberty and equality."
23281,I will reserve discussion of it for a moment,,when I have more information.
23282,"As symptomatic of the common man's malaise , he is most significant :",,his struggles and triumphs resonate with the everyday experiences of many.
23283,"Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not",,"to say precarious, situation?"
23284,What is the common,,cold?
23285,Let's take a panoramic look back,,at the journey we've been through.
23286,Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of,,Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of knowledge?
23287,And the basic character of that liberalism,,"is a commitment to individual freedom, equality before the law, and democratic governance."
23288,Ralph Gabriel gave it the name,,"""the Gateway Arch."""
23289,But there's a subjective side,,to every objective reality.
23290,"Built upon seven hills , Istanbul , like Rome , is one of",,the world's most historic and culturally rich cities.
23291,"At the moment , many of",,"At the moment, many of"
23292,"Even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for",,the old sections will still show signs of wear and age compared to the new ones.
23293,"For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia",,"have been connected by trade routes that facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures."
23294,Founded in the,,"13th century, the University of Cambridge is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world."
23295,"About a thousand years after that , when the Roman Empire",,"had fallen and Europe was in the midst of the Middle Ages,"
23296,"On May 11,330",,"On May 11, 330, the city of Constantinople was officially founded by Emperor Constantine the Great."
23297,When that was broken up after the First World,,"War, the territories were divided among the victorious powers."
23298,Most of the sights lie in the old section,,of the city.
23299,Across the bridge on the,,"other side of the river, the sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the landscape."
23300,"Passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar",,visible in the distance below.
23301,At the top of the hill the buildings,,seemed smaller.
23302,On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that,,he had built it all by himself.
23303,A few years later,,"A few years later, she had completely transformed her life."
23304,"Nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of",,the city.
23305,After the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted,,the Hagia Sophia into a mosque.
23306,"Inside over the first door I saw one of these , which shows",,a map of the building and its exits.
23307,On the columns around the immense dome,,are intricate carvings and vibrant mosaics.
23308,Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine Emperors were,,crowned.
23309,"Directly opposite is the emperor's door ,",,which leads to the imperial chambers.
23310,Outside,,it was raining heavily.
23311,Across the street on my right I,,saw a small park with children playing.
23312,It was laid out in 196 for,,It was laid out in 1964 for
23313,Statues and other monuments that stood there were,,removed or destroyed.
23314,"The round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and",,are topped with elegant domes.
23315,"Inside , the walls are covered with blue and white",,tiles.
23316,It stands in the middle of what was once the,,a bustling city square.
23317,"Called the Marmara Gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs",,pointing the way from the main entrance.
23318,It's a great favorite of the university students,,It's a great favorite of the university students to gather at the campus café for coffee and study sessions.
23319,There is still,,hope.
23320,I found it fairly depressing,,to see how little things had changed.
23321,Outside I walked past,,the park where children were playing.
23322,There are a good,,There are a good number of reasons to consider.
23323,At one time about,,half of all American households had a landline telephone.
23324,"Next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and",,kitchenware.
23325,"In the court once more , I went right toward the",,bench.
23326,"Going through a door into another small court ,",,he found himself in a garden filled with vibrant flowers and a tranquil fountain.
23327,They are made of gold and covered,,in a layer of intricate engravings.
23328,It wasn't his fault that,,the project failed.
23329,The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its,,own set of challenges.
23330,"As a result , life had",,become more complex and challenging.
23331,Once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for,,"attention, he felt a weight lift from his shoulders."
23332,"He had almost forgotten them , although they had",,been a significant part of his life.
23333,Dogs did something,,Dogs barked.
23334,They were constantly assuring you that you,,were doing a great job.
23335,Now it became increasingly apparent that there were,,more issues to address than initially thought.
23336,What in the world were you going to do with a lot,,of money?
23337,Why in the world couldn't he live in one,,Why in the world couldn't he live in one place?
23338,"It worried him , this inability to get the",,image out of his mind.
23339,He would wake up in the middle,,"of the night, feeling a chill run down his spine."
23340,Was it possible that as people grow older,,they become more set in their ways?
23341,Or was the answer,,right in front of me all along?
23342,Did older people work,,"Yes, older people worked."
23343,"Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing",,and refining their skills with each passing year?
23344,They could be done or left undone,,They could be done or left undone.
23345,During all his busy life he had only,,one true passion.
23346,This habit had become so fixed over the years that it,,seemed impossible to break.
23347,He looked at the luminous,,sky.
23348,It was five,,o'clock when she finally arrived.
23349,"On some distant farm a rooster crowed and ,",,"the sun began to rise, casting a warm glow over the fields."
23350,He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over,,his head.
23351,At least he could buy,,At least he could buy a small gift.
23352,"Thus committed ,",,they proceeded with the plan.
23353,`` There '',,is a place for everything and everything in its place.
23354,Best not to get,,involved.
23355,Add things as you find,,Add things as you find them.
23356,He didn't even ask the,,price.
23357,"After all , if you were going to set up a workshop",,"you would need to consider the space, tools, and materials required for your projects."
23358,It gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get,,rid of the weight.
23359,He had made such a fuss about buying that,,"expensive car, but now it just sits in the garage unused."
23360,He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar,,and closed the door behind him.
23361,That was where the pegboard would go on,,the wall.
23362,In front of it,,stands a tall oak tree.
23363,How in the world did one attach a,,How in the world did one attach a horse to a carriage?
23364,How did one attach anything to a stone,,"One attached anything to a stone by using adhesives, ties, or carvings."
23365,After the pegboard there,,was a shelf.
23366,He sat down on an old,,wooden chair.
23367,Perhaps one bored holes in the stone,,with a drill.
23368,"But then , when you stuck things into the holes",,they wouldn't come out easily.
23369,He turned his attention,,to the task at hand.
23370,Perhaps that was the,,reason for her sudden change in behavior.
23371,They lay on the cellar,,"floor, shivering in the cold."
23372,How could anyone know what to do,,without being told or having prior experience?
23373,Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard,,to ensure it's done safely and securely.
23374,Then at least he would have a place to,,stay.
23375,After that everything,,fell into place.
23376,He went upstairs,,to get some rest.
23377,To his amazement,,", the painting he had bought for a mere $50 at a garage sale was appraised as a rare masterpiece worth over a million dollars."
23378,He didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much,,of a challenge.
23379,The only trouble was that he himself,,was unaware of his own talent.
23380,That was why he hadn't been,,able to attend the meeting.
23381,"No , he didn't",,"No, he didn't."
23382,There wasn't any such,,thing.
23383,There was a fellow named,,Bob.
23384,Nobody liked to hire him because you never could,,tell what he would do next.
23385,"If he was sober , which was doubtful ,",,he would have noticed the error immediately.
23386,So,,so
23387,While,,"While walking through the park, she noticed a rare bird perched on a tree branch."
23388,"`` Now '' , he said , `` we got to",,get moving. ''
23389,then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench,,provided ample lighting for the tasks at hand.
23390,It all did look,,so perfect.
23391,`` By the way,,", how are you doing?"
23392,I guess you,,could say that.
23393,Before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy,,cable.
23394,That ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy,,they ain't got time to fix it.
23395,Instead of being depressed by,,"the rainy weather, she found joy in the sound of raindrops and the freshness it brought to the air."
23396,At least the moment was postponed when he had,,to face the truth.
23397,He followed,,the map to find the hidden treasure.
23398,As usual,,", everything went according to plan."
23399,"`` Well '' , he said , ``",,I didn't expect that. ''
23400,He oughta be able to build a,,He oughta be able to build a house.
23401,`` I was just sayin' to him that I'm all,,"set, thanks for asking."
23402,"`` Oh , that's wonderful",,! I'm so glad to hear that.
23403,`` I have a thousand,,`` I have a thousand regrets. ``
23404,"Doors that won't open , and doors that",,won't close.
23405,`` But those are the things I built,,`` But those are the things I built with my own hands.``
23406,`` Those are the things I can do,,`` for you.```
23407,`` I've been waiting to get these things,,I've been waiting to get these things for a long time.
23408,"`` We won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides",,I need to move on.
23409,`` And I'll take,,`` And I'll take the blue pill. ''
23410,The two of them,,walked together in silence.
23411,That had been how,,it had always been.
23412,For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time,,it was clear that his mind was wandering far and wide.
23413,But now the,,situation has changed.
23414,The big waking,,The big waking moment came when she realized the truth.
23415,`` What did I,,do wrong?''
23416,`` Did I see him about to,,cross the street?
23417,Or maybe poling up the south fork of the Forked,,"River, we'll find a quiet spot to camp."
23418,Maybe I saw him on a barge with,,"a group of other people, or perhaps he was alone."
23419,And I'll take,,it from here.
23420,He had taken,,the package from the shelf.
23421,Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back,,"there with his guitar, ready to play."
23422,He can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray,,eyes.
23423,Because if you can't then nobody else can,,Because if you can't then nobody else can either.
23424,For you don't share him,,"I can't complete this sentence as it stands because it's incomplete and somewhat ambiguous. However, if you meant to say ""For you don't share"
23425,If it is love,,then it is meant to be.
23426,Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise,,that he will call you once he arrives.
23427,"And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he",,"lives or dies, his legacy continues to inspire others."
23428,You feel him every,,time you touch the piano keys.
23429,You think : `` Did he feel,,Did he feel betrayed?
23430,It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you,,It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you go.
23431,that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn,,on whenever you needed him.
23432,You wonder if he looks at his,,watch as often as you do.
23433,`` Damn the world,,`` and all its troubles.``
23434,"The bands were impatient , but",,the crowd was still buzzing with excitement.
23435,It was like being in the concert hall in,,"Vienna, surrounded by the rich acoustics and the grandeur of the golden age of music."
23436,He was good and they knew that what he was doing for,,them was important.
23437,So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on,,the way he said it.
23438,"If a man was good , if he was going to be governor",,he would have to keep his promises and serve the people with integrity.
23439,You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up,,you realized you hadn't been paying attention.
23440,It was a place full of courage and,,determination.
23441,"He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you",,could feel the weight of his words in the silence that followed.
23442,`` I should have stayed at,,home.
23443,There was no lock because,,the door was always kept closed.
23444,A lock on the toilet,,prevents unauthorized use.
23445,"After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration",,in the once-struggling community.
23446,There were more indications,,that the project was failing.
23447,"I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed",,that the numbers seemed off.
23448,It really looked as if a change,,was about to come.
23449,But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with,,"the earlier interventions), the situation began to deteriorate once again."
23450,For over a hundred years Southerners have felt,,a deep connection to their heritage and history.
23451,"It's infuriating , this feeling that one is",,being ignored or dismissed.
23452,"By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask ,",,do Northerners presume to dictate our way of life?
23453,"In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave",,"system was essential to their economy and way of life, and that it was protected by the Constitution."
23454,"At the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of",,a threat to worry about.
23455,The line is a,,straight path that extends indefinitely in both directions.
23456,People talk about `` the,,"people'' a lot, but who are they really?"
23457,The expression has become,,a cliché.
23458,"But people can't be made to integrate , socialize (",,or interact against their will.
23459,They didn't seem to be,,paying attention.
23460,A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that,,"""ignorance of the law excuses no one."""
23461,"Moreover , the law of the",,land must be upheld.
23462,it has been,,a long day.
23463,The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in,,the face of genuine experience.
23464,The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their,,just powers from the consent of the governed.
23465,The phrase `` consent of the,,governed'' refers to the idea that a government's legitimacy and authority are derived from the agreement or approval of the people it governs.
23466,How do we define,,success?
23467,Is the consent of the governed,,essential for a just and legitimate government?
23468,Calhoun dealt with this question in,,"his book ""A Community of Individuals."""
23469,Who will say that our country is,,the best in the world?
23470,That regional peculiarities do not,,That regional peculiarities do not disappear overnight.
23471,That the Court order does not unequally,,affect any party involved.
23472,Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is,,regarded with suspicion and hostility?
23473,A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular,,disturbance.
23474,He seemed a little surprised that it,,was so easy.
23475,I murmured something about a possible difference,,in our perspectives.
23476,One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the,,"the indifferent gaze of a stranger, the dismissive tone of a colleague, or the silent treatment from a friend."
23477,Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) --,,Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- often find themselves at odds with the more conservative elements within their region.
23478,The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take,,for granted.
23479,If there's no suitable academy in your,,"area, consider online courses or tutoring services."
23480,New England academies welcome fugitives from the,,South.
23481,It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is,,between different cultural practices in modern society.
23482,A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the,,A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the city council.

23488,"Well , after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating",,"the different ethnic and religious groups into their own neighborhoods, it seems like we're just repeating history."
23489,And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one,,finds the highest levels of creativity and resourcefulness.
23490,There is a legend ( Hawthorne records,,it in his notebooks ) that the old mansion was haunted by the spirits of its former inhabitants.

23495,"A man must be able to say , `` Father , I",,have done my best. ''
23496,He also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the,,"labors of the masses."""
23497,After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while,,) likely to become a significant force in its own right?
23498,It is a question which New Englanders,,often debate.

23511,"New England , as everyone knows ,",,is a region in the northeastern United States.
23512,There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief,,attractions of the city.
23513,Why should this be,,a concern?
23514,"It is true that New England , more than any",,"other region in the United States, has a rich history of colonial architecture and traditions."
23515,But I think that something,,is better than nothing.

23527,When we consider the electronic industry potential for,,"growth, it is evident that emerging technologies and increasing demand for innovative devices will play a crucial role."
23528,The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that,,"the integration of advanced electronic systems in healthcare can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and patient care overall."
23529,The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be,,"revolutionary, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and patient monitoring."
23530,We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of,,the focus on biological processes and materials in medical treatment and research.
23531,Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such,,"devices as X-ray machines, MRI scanners, and pacemakers."
23532,Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep,,tissue massage and therapy.
23533,In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of,,artificial intelligence in healthcare.

23635,It is hard to,,believe that it's already over.
23636,Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took,,that contributed to the complex dynamics of the Congo's colonial history.
23637,As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer,,than 30 political parties.
23638,"First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu )",,who opposed the Belgian colonial rule and sought independence.

23640,"And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry",,to see change happen quickly.
23641,"However , the positions of all",,the players on the field are crucial for the team's success.

23674,Others writing on Faulkner have found the phrase,,"""the past is never dead, it's not even past"" particularly significant."

23681,It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say,,what exactly happens in the story.
23682,To believe otherwise,,is to ignore the evidence.
23683,But in looking at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the,,"South, we can better understand the complexities of his work and the influences that shaped his writing."
23684,His earliest work reflected heavy influences,,from his mentors and the artistic movements of the time.
23685,Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the,,country.
23686,"Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he",,broke away from it in many of his works.
23687,"Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed",,it in a different manner.
23688,Faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts in,,the literature of his time.
23689,"Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had",,never experienced such wild living himself.
23690,"Others who wrote of low characters and low life included Thomas Bangs Thorpe , creator",,"of the famous character, The Big Bear of Arkansas."
23691,"and George Washington Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood perpetrated more",,than a few outrageous and often ribald adventures in the antebellum South.
23692,Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner,,was often critiquing the societal norms and moral values of the time.
23693,nor is there need to add that among them are some,,who are more skilled and knowledgeable than others.
23694,Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to,,make his mark in the world.

23747,And the evening and the,,morning were the first day.
23748,And let them be for lights in the firmament of the,,heaven to give light upon the earth.
23749,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,",,and the lesser light to rule the night.

23755,"So God created man in his own image, in the image",,of God he created him; male and female he created them.
23756,And God saw every thing that he had,,"made, and, behold, it was very good."

23890,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon",,"the ground, after their kind, went forth out of the ark."
23891,And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean,,"beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
23892,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat,",,"and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."

23894,Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even,,as the green herb have I given you all things.
23895,"But flesh with the life thereof, which is",,"the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."
23896,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be",,shed.
23897,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring",,"forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
23898,"And God spake unto Noah, and",,"said unto him, Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
23899,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with",,you and your descendants after you.
23900,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between",,"me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations."
23901,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be",,for a token of the covenant between me and the earth.

23903,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which",,I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
23904,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were",,"Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
23905,These are the three sons of Noah: and,,the earth was divided among them.
23906,And Noah began to be an,,"husbandman, and he planted a vineyard."
23907,"And he drank of the wine, and was",,merry.
23908,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness",,"of his father, and told his two brethren without."
23909,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew",,what his younger son had done unto him.
23910,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant",,of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
23911,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God",,"of Israel, who has visited and redeemed his people."
23912,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the",,tents of Shem.
23913,And Noah lived after the flood,,three hundred and fifty years.
23914,And all the days of Noah were nine,,hundred and fifty years.
23915,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,",,and Japheth.
23916,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai,",,"and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."

23921,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and",,"Raamah, and Sabtecha."
23922,And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to,,be a mighty one in the earth.
23923,He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is,,"said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD."
23924,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech,",,"and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
23925,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and",,he built Nineveh.
23926,And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:,,the same is a great city.
23927,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and",,"Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, and Pathrusim, and Casluhim, out of whom came Phil"
23928,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of",,"whom came the Philistines,) and Caphtorim."
23929,And Canaan begat Sidon his,,"firstborn, and Heth,"
23930,"And the Jebusite, and the",,"Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Canaanite."
23931,"And the Hivite, and the",,"Amorite, and the Jebusite."
23932,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and",,their families spread abroad.
23933,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto",,"Gaza; as thou goest, till thou come to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim,"
23934,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after",,"their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations."
23935,"Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the",,"brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born."
23936,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur,",,"and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
23937,"And the children of Aram; Uz,",,"Hul, Gether, and Mash."
23938,And Arphaxad begat Salah;,,and Salah begat Eber.
23939,And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for,,in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
23940,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and",,"Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, and"
23941,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all",,these are the sons of Joktan.
23942,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou",,goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.
23943,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families,",,"after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations."
23944,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their",,nations.
23945,And the whole earth was of,,"one language, and of one speech."
23946,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they",,"found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there."
23947,"And they said one to another, Go to,",,"let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly."
23948,And the LORD came down to see the city,,"and the tower, which the children of men builded."
23949,"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their",,"language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
23950,So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of,,all the earth.
23951,These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred,,"and two years old, and he begat Arphaxad."
23952,And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five,,"hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
23953,And Arphaxad lived five and,,"thirty years, and begat Salah."
23954,And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred,,"and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
23955,And Salah lived thirty,,years in the land of his fathers.

23960,And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred,,and nine years.
23961,And Reu lived two and,,thirty years.
23962,And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred,,"and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
23963,And Serug lived thirty,,years and begat Nahor.
23964,And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two,,"hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
23965,And Nahor lived nine and,,"twenty years, and died."
23966,And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred,,"and two years, and begat sons and daughters."
23967,"And Terah lived seventy years, and",,"begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
23968,Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat,,"Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
23969,And Haran died before his father Terah in the,,"land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans."
23970,But Sarai was barren;,,she had no child.
23971,And the days of Terah were two hundred,,and five years.
23972,"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from",,"thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee."
23973,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless",,"thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing."
23974,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth",,thee.
23975,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him:",,and Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.
23976,And Abram passed through the land unto the,,"place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh."
23977,"And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this",,land.
23978,"And Abram journeyed, going on",,still journeying toward the land of Canaan.
23979,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into,,Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
23980,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well",,with me for thy sake.
23981,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into",,"Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
23982,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her",,before Pharaoh.
23983,"And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and",,"oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she-asses, and camels."
23984,And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house,,with great plagues.
23985,"And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done",,unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
23986,"Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to",,me for a wife.
23987,And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent,,"him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
23988,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and",,"all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
23989,And Abram was very rich in,,"livestock, silver, and gold."
23990,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the",,"place of God, where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai."
23991,"Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at",,the first.
23992,"And Lot also, which went with Abram,",,"had flocks, and herds, and tents."
23993,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell",,together.
23994,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen,,of Lot's cattle.
23995,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between",,"me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren."
23996,Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot,,journeyed east.
23997,"Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in",,the cities of the plain.
23998,But the men of Sodom were wicked,,and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
23999,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will",,"I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
24000,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in",,the breadth of it.
24001,"Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of",,Mamre.
24002,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,",,"Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim."
24003,All these were joined together in the vale,,"of Shaveh, which is the King's dale."
24004,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and",,in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
24005,"And the Horites in their mount Seir,",,unto Elath and Ezion-geber.
24006,"And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all",,"the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar."
24007,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and",,"Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar,"
24008,And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom,,"and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain."
24009,And they took all the goods of Sodom and,,"Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way."
24010,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who",,"dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
24011,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants,",,"born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan."
24012,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote",,them.
24013,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his",,brother whom he had left behind.
24014,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:,,and he was the priest of the most high God.
24015,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of",,"the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:"
24016,"And blessed be the most high God, which",,hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.
24017,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give",,"me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
24018,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand",,"unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
24019,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the",,"old men, and the children, and the women."
24020,"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision,",,"saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
24021,"And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go",,"childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
24022,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed:",,and one born in my house is mine heir.
24023,And he believed in the LORD; and,,he counted it to him for righteousness.
24024,"And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out",,"of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
24025,"And he said, LORD God, whereby shall",,I know that thou art the Lord?
24026,"And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,",,and laid each piece one against another: but between the pieces he did not divide the birds.
24027,And when the fowls came down upon,,"the carcasses, Abram drove them away."
24028,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon",,"Abraham, and behold, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."
24029,"And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I",,judge.
24030,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace;,,and be buried in a good old age.
24031,But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again:,,for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
24032,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was",,"dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
24033,"The Kenites, and the",,"Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
24034,"And the Hittites, and the",,"Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
24035,"And the Amorites, and the Canaanites,",,"and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
24036,Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she,,"had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
24037,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she",,"saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
24038,And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of,,water in the wilderness.
24039,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou",,go?
24040,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return",,to thy lord.
24041,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply",,"thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
24042,"And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest",,me.
24043,"Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,",,it is between Kadesh and Bered.
24044,And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram,,called his name Ishmael.
24045,And Abram was fourscore and six years,,old when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
24046,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and",,"said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
24047,And I will make my covenant between me,,"and you, and I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the sky."
24048,And Abram fell on his face:,,"and God talked with him, saying,"
24049,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee,",,and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
24050,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall",,be Abraham.
24051,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make",,"nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
24052,"And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant",,therefore thou shalt circumcise the flesh of thy foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and thee
24053,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and",,your seed after you.
24054,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it,,shall be a token of the covenant betwixt us.
24055,"And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that",,soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
24056,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt",,"not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name."
24057,"And Abraham said unto God, O",,that my lord would hearken unto me.
24058,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall",,bear unto thee.
24059,"And he left off talking with him,",,and walked away.
24060,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when",,he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
24061,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when",,he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
24062,In the selfsame day was Abraham,,an hundred years old.
24063,"And all the men of his house, born in the house,",,shall be circumcised with him.
24064,And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and,,he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
24065,"And said, My LORD, if now I have found favor in",,"thy sight, then let my LORD, I pray thee, go in to thy servant."
24066,"Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and",,"let me wash my feet, and rest under the tree."
24067,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly",,"three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
24068,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good,",,and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
24069,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set",,"it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
24070,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy",,wife?
24071,Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and,,it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
24072,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed",,"old, shall I have pleasure?"
24073,"And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,",,"Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?"
24074,Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return,,"Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return, and Sarah shall have a son."
24075,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed",,not.
24076,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom:",,and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
24077,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide",,from Abraham that thing which I do?
24078,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and",,all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him.
24079,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and",,"Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
24080,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the",,pattern I showed them.
24081,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went",,toward Sodom.
24082,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou",,also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
24083,Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy,,and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
24084,"And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within",,"the city, I will spare all the place for their sakes."
24085,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me",,"to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes."
24086,"And he spake unto him yet again, and",,"said unto him, Thus saith the Lord."
24087,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had",,finished speaking with Abraham.
24088,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,",,"compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
24089,"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came",,in to thee this night?
24090,And Lot went out at the door unto,,"him, and shut the door after him."
24091,"And said, I pray you,",,"sir, could you help me?"
24092,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot",,"into the house with them, and shut to the door."
24093,And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with,,"blindness, so that they could not find the door."
24094,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before",,the face of the LORD.
24095,"And Lot said unto them,",,"Oh, not so, my lords; oh, pass not by your servant, I pray you."
24096,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also,",,that I will not overthrow the city for which thou hast spoken.
24097,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot",,protect thee here any longer.
24098,The sun was risen upon the,,"horizon, casting a warm glow over the landscape."
24099,Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah,,brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven.
24100,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the",,"inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
24101,"But his wife looked back from behind him,",,and saw the city turn into a pillar of salt.
24102,And Abraham gat up early in the morning to,,the place where he stood before the LORD.
24103,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will",,lie with him.
24104,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and",,"lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
24105,Thus were both the daughters of,,Thus were both the daughters of the king married with great pomp and ceremony.
24106,"And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab:",,the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
24107,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi:",,the same is Ammon unto this day.
24108,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and",,"dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
24109,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my",,sister.
24110,But Abimelech had not come near her: and he,,"said, ""Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"""
24111,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and",,told them all these things.
24112,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest",,thou that thou hast done these things?
24113,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not",,in this place; and they will kill me for my wife's sake.
24114,And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my,,father.
24115,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and",,gave them unto Abraham.
24116,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is",,before thee; dwell where it pleaseth thee.
24117,"So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and",,"his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children."
24118,For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs,,"of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
24119,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and",,the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
24120,"For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age,",,as the Lord had promised.
24121,And Abraham called the name of his son that was,,"born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
24122,And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight,,days old.
24123,"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when",,his son Isaac was born unto him.
24124,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh,",,so that all that hear will laugh with me.
24125,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given",,children?
24126,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made",,a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
24127,And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the,,"Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking."
24128,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the",,"son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
24129,And the thing was very grievous in,,his sight.
24130,And also of the son of the bondwoman will,,I not write.
24131,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and",,there was no more to be found in the wilderness.
24132,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine",,hand.
24133,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and",,"she went and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad to drink."
24134,"And God was with the lad; and he grew,",,and he waxed strong.
24135,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother,,took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
24136,And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of,,water that Abimelech's servants had seized.
24137,"And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst",,"thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today."
24138,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them",,to Abimelech.
24139,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs,,of the flock by themselves.
24140,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven",,ewes which thou hast set by themselves?
24141,"And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,",,"that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well."
24142,Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because,,there they sware both of them.
24143,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the",,"chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
24144,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there",,"on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God."
24145,And Abraham sojourned in the,,land of Canaan.
24146,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham,",,"and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am."
24147,Then on the third day Abraham lifted up,,his eyes and saw the place afar off.
24148,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and",,"I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
24149,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb",,for a burnt offering.
24150,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and",,took the knife to slay his son.
24151,And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of,,"heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I."
24152,And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said,,"to this day, ""In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen."""
24153,And the angel of the LORD called unto,,Abraham out of heaven.
24154,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou",,"hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:"
24155,And in thy seed shall all the nations of the,,earth be blessed.
24156,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up",,and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
24157,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham,",,"""Say, behold, Sarah thy wife shall have a son."""
24158,"Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother,",,were the sons of Nahor.
24159,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and",,"and Kedar, and Nebaioth."
24160,And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah,,"begat unto Nahor, Bethuel's father."
24161,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare",,"Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah."
24162,And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years,,old when she died.
24163,And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of,,Canaan.
24164,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead,",,and went to speak with the Hittites.
24165,I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of,,"a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
24166,And the children of Heth,,"answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
24167,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people",,"of the land, even to the children of Heth."
24168,And Abraham bowed down himself before,,the people of the land.
24169,"And Ephron answered Abraham,",,"saying, ""My lord, listen to me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and"
24170,"My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of",,silver.
24171,Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of,,Heth.
24172,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field",,"of Machpelah, which is before Mamre."
24173,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto",,"Ephron, and unto his heirs forever."
24174,"And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age:",,and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
24175,"And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over",,"all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:"
24176,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my",,kindred.
24177,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that",,thou bring not my son thither again.
24178,"And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt",,bring her back to her father's house.
24179,And the servant put his hand under the thigh of,,"Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter."
24180,"And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee,",,grant me this day to meet with thy favor and show kindness to my master.
24181,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters",,of the men of the city come out to draw water.
24182,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me,",,"I pray thee, have a drink of water."
24183,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let",,"down her pitcher from her shoulder, and gave him drink."
24184,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will",,"draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking."
24185,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again",,"unto the well to draw water, and drew for all the camels."
24186,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit",,"the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit, he remained silent in awe."
24187,"And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is",,"there not a damsel thy father's daughter? for behold, thou art very fair."
24188,"And she said unto him, I am the daughter of",,a prophet.
24189,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw",,and provender ready for your camels.
24190,And the man bowed down his,,head in gratitude.
24191,"And the damsel ran, and told them",,of the knight's return.
24192,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban:",,and he was a shepherd.
24193,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou",,without?
24194,And there was set meat before him to eat: but he,,"said, I will not eat until I have told my errand."
24195,"And he said, I",,will do it.
24196,And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she,,was old.
24197,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to",,my son of the daughters of the Canaanites.
24198,"But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to",,my kindred.
24199,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure",,the LORD hath spoken of it.
24200,"Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred;",,though thou fail to find a wife for me there.
24201,"And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of",,"my father, if thou wilt now show kindness unto me, and give me a sign, the same thing that happened to my father will happen to me"
24202,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from",,the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
24203,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let",,her be thy wife.
24204,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their",,"words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
24205,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us",,"a few days, or until she is ready to go."
24206,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered",,me.
24207,"And they said, We will call the",,baby Noah.
24208,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou",,go with this man?
24209,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and",,"her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
24210,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and",,followed the man.
24211,And Isaac came from the way of the well,,of the living one who sees me.
24212,And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and,,"he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming."
24213,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when",,"she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel."
24214,And the servant told Isaac all,,that had happened concerning Rebekah.
24215,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became",,his wife; and he loved her.
24216,"Then again Abraham took a wife,",,and her name was Keturah.
24217,"And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and",,"Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
24218,And Jokshan begat,,Ephah and Epher.
24219,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and",,"Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah."
24220,And Abraham gave all that,,he had to Isaac.
24221,"But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent",,"them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
24222,And these are the days of the years of Abraham's,,life: a hundred and seventy-five years.
24223,"Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age,",,"an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people."
24224,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in",,"the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre."
24225,The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of,,Heth was for a burial place.
24226,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God",,blessed Isaac his son.
24227,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son,",,"whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham."
24228,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according",,"to their generations: Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
24229,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur,",,"Naphish, and Kedemah."
24230,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by",,"their towns and their settlements: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam"
24231,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou",,goest toward Assyria.
24232,And these are the generations of,,"Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham."
24233,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the",,"daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
24234,"And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren:",,"and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
24235,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be",,"so, why am I thus?"
24236,And when her days to be delivered were,,"fulfilled, she brought forth a son."
24237,"And the first came out red, all over like",,a hairy garment.
24238,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man",,"of the field; but Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents."
24239,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat",,of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
24240,And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came,,"from the field, and he was faint."
24241,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same",,red pottage; for I am faint.
24242,"And Jacob said, Sell me",,this day thy birthright.
24243,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to",,die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
24244,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he",,swore to him.
24245,Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and,,"drink, and rose up, and went his way."
24246,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the",,first famine that was in the days of Abraham.
24247,"And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into",,Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
24248,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my",,"charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
24249,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people",,"might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guilt upon us."
24250,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this",,man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
24251,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the",,same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
24252,"And the man waxed great, and went forward,",,and grew and increased more and more.
24253,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds,",,"and possession of menservants, and possession of maidservants, and possession of camels, and possession of asses."
24254,For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of,,"Abimelech, king of the Philistines, the Philistines had stopped them up and filled them with earth."
24255,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us;",,for thou art much mightier than we.
24256,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent",,in the valley of Gerar.
24257,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and",,found there a well of springing water.
24258,"And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours:",,and they called the name of the well Esek; because they strove for it.
24259,"And they digged another well, and strove for that",,also.
24260,And he went up,,the mountain.
24261,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the",,Lord.
24262,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of",,"his friends, and Phicol the chief captain of his army."
24263,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing",,"ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
24264,"And he made them a feast,",,spreading out a grand array of dishes before them.
24265,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another:",,"and they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another:"
24266,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him",,of the well which they had digged.
24267,And he called it Shebah: therefore the name,,of the well was called Beer-sheba;
24268,And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the,,"daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
24269,Which were a grief of mind,,Which were a source of mental anguish
24270,"And he said, Behold now, I am old,",,and I know not the day of my death.
24271,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy",,bow.
24272,"And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,",,"that I may eat, and my soul may bless thee."
24273,And Rebekah heard when Isaac,,spoke to Esau his son.
24274,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I",,"heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
24275,"Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may",,eat and be satisfied.
24276,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice",,and do what I command you.
24277,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the",,goats.
24278,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may",,eat of it and bless thee.
24279,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother",,is a hairy man.
24280,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a",,prodigal son.
24281,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse,",,"my son; only obey my voice, and go with me."
24282,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother:",,and she made them into a pie.
24283,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with",,"her, and put them upon Jacob her younger son."
24284,And she put the skins of the kids of the goats,,upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck.
24285,"And she gave the savory meat and the bread, which",,"she had prepared, to the hungry travelers."
24286,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and",,"he said, Here am I; behold, it is I, thy son."
24287,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so",,"quickly, my son?"
24288,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may",,"feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not."
24289,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said,",,"""The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."""
24290,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy,",,as Esau's.
24291,"And he said, Art thou my very",,doubt?
24292,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come",,"near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not."
24293,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the",,"fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine."
24294,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou?",,"And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau."
24295,"And he said, Thy brother came with",,an angel of God in his company.
24296,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing,",,my father?
24297,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be",,"the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
24298,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise,",,flee to Haran at once.
24299,"And tarry with him a few days,",,that you may learn from his wisdom and experience.
24300,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto",,"him, Go not to take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
24301,"Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take",,thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
24302,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and",,multiply thee; that thou mayest be a multitude of people.
24303,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son",,"of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
24304,And that Jacob obeyed his father and,,went to Egypt as he was commanded.
24305,And Esau seeing that the daughters of,,"Canaan were evil in his father's sight,"
24306,"Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath",,"the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth."
24307,And Jacob went out from,,Beersheba and went toward Haran.
24308,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely",,the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
24309,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none",,"other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
24310,And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the,,name of that city was Luz at the first.
24311,So that I come again to my father's house,,"in peace, I will make things right."
24312,"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and",,of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
24313,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into",,the land of the people of the east.
24314,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be",,ye?
24315,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the",,Samaritan?
24316,"And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He",,is well.
24317,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the",,sheep should be gathered together.
24318,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till",,they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we will water the sheep.
24319,"And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came",,with her father's sheep; for she was a shepherdess.
24320,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted",,up his voice and wept.
24321,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that",,he had come to help with the flock.
24322,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou",,"shalt not go empty away, for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake."
24323,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou",,therefore serve me for nought?
24324,And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder,,"was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
24325,Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel,,was beautiful and well favored.
24326,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve",,thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
24327,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee,",,than that thou shouldest take her.
24328,And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him,,"but a few days, for the love he had to her."
24329,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my",,days are fulfilled.
24330,And Laban gathered together all the men,,"of the place, and made a feast."
24331,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his",,daughter and brought her to him.
24332,And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah,,"a handmaid, whose name was Zilpah."
24333,"And Laban said, It must not be so done in",,our country.
24334,"Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the",,other week.
24335,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and",,then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to wife also.
24336,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter,,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter a dowry and servants.
24337,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel",,more than Leah.
24338,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated,",,"He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren."
24339,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will",,I praise the Lord; for I have obtained a son.
24340,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her",,"sister, and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
24341,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in",,"God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
24342,"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she",,"shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
24343,And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to,,be his wife.
24344,"And Bilhah conceived, and",,bare him a son.
24345,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice,",,and hath given me a son.
24346,"And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again,",,and she bore Jacob a second son.
24347,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my",,sister.
24348,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took",,her bag and quickly headed back to retrieve it.
24349,And Zilpah Leah's maid,,bore him two sons.
24350,"And Leah said, A troop cometh:",,and she called his name Gad.
24351,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare,,Dinah.
24352,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will",,call me happy.
24353,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she",,conceived and bare Jacob a son.
24354,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have",,given my maiden to my husband.
24355,"And Leah conceived again, and",,"she bore a son, and she called his name Judah, saying, ""Now I will praise the Lord."""
24356,"And afterwards she bare a daughter,",,and called her name Dinah.
24357,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened",,"to her, and opened her womb."
24358,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and",,she called his name Samson.
24359,"And she called his name Joseph; and said,",,The Lord shall add to me another son.
24360,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban,",,"""Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country."""
24361,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and",,I will go my way.
24362,"And he said, Appoint me thy",,treasurer.
24363,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have",,served thee these many years.
24364,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it",,might be according to thy word.
24365,And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and,,the Israelites.
24366,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and",,"brought forth young that were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted."
24367,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not",,in the best pastures.
24368,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle,",,"and silver, and gold."
24369,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and,",,"behold, it was not toward him as before."
24370,"And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy",,fathers and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
24371,And Jacob sent and called Rachel and,,"Leah, his wives, to the field of his flock."
24372,"And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward",,me as before.
24373,And ye know that with all my,,heart I have not hidden from you anything that is profitable for you.
24374,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages",,ten times.
24375,Thus God hath taken away the cattle of,,Pharaoh and given it to me.
24376,And the angel of God spake unto me in a,,"dream, saying, ""Jacob, Jacob;"" and I said, ""Here am I."""
24377,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there",,yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
24378,Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath,,shut up his mercy from us.
24379,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is",,ours.
24380,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his",,sons and his wives upon camels.
24381,And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel,,had stolen the household gods of her father.
24382,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian,",,"his father-in-law, and fled with his two wives and all that he had."
24383,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and",,"went out of the land of Canaan, and came to Haran."
24384,And it was told Laban on the,,third day.
24385,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him",,until he overtook him.
24386,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said",,"unto him, Beware that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
24387,Then Laban,,"said to him, ""Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"""
24388,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away",,"unawares to me, and carried away thy brethren?"
24389,And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and,,my daughters.
24390,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst",,"to see thy native land and the smoke from thine own hearth, yet I beseech thee, tarry a little longer."
24391,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for",,"I thought with myself, I will surely be taken away from you."
24392,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them",,in a folder on her computer.
24393,This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have,,"not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten."
24394,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and",,at night I was filled with frost.
24395,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;",,and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
24396,"And Jacob took a stone, and",,set it up for a pillar.
24397,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones,",,and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
24398,And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha:,,but Jacob called it Galeed.
24399,"And Laban said, This heap is a",,witness between me and thee this day.
24400,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me",,"and thee, when we are absent one from another."
24401,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my",,"daughters, then thou shalt be punished."
24402,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold",,"this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee."
24403,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor,",,"and the God of Terah, is the God whom I do fear."
24404,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat",,bread.
24405,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and",,"daughters, and blessed them: and he departed, and returned unto his place."
24406,"And Jacob went on his way, and",,the angels of God met him.
24407,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's",,army.
24408,And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother,,"to the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
24409,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy",,"servant Jacob saith thus: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:"
24410,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have",,And I have silver and gold.
24411,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau,",,"and he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
24412,Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was,,"with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;"
24413,"And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite",,"it, then the other company which is left shall escape."
24414,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed",,"as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
24415,And he lodged there that same night; and took of that,,which he had in his hand a present for Esau his brother.
24416,"Two hundred she goats, and twenty he",,goats.
24417,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and",,fifty sheep were part of the caravan.
24418,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee,",,"saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
24419,"Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present",,for my lord Esau.
24420,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the",,same.
24421,So went the present over before him: and,,he could hardly believe his eyes.
24422,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his",,"two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
24423,"And he took them, and sent them over",,the river.
24424,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a,,man with him until the breaking of the day.
24425,"And he said, Let me",,now go in peace.
24426,"And he said unto him, What is",,written in the law? How readest thou?
24427,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for",,"as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
24428,And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I,,"have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
24429,And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose,,upon him.
24430,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and",,Leah and Rachel behind.
24431,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the",,ground seven times.
24432,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and",,"fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
24433,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and",,"the queen, and they all wept."
24434,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:",,and they went into the house.
24435,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And",,"she said, These are my brother's, and he sent them as a sign of peace and to show his goodwill towards thee."
24436,"And Esau said, I have enough, my",,brother; keep that which thou hast.
24437,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and",,"go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me"
24438,So Esau returned that day,,on his way to Seir.
24439,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths",,for his cattle.
24440,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land",,of Canaan.
24441,"And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at",,"the hand of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money."
24442,And he erected there an,,altar.
24443,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto",,"Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
24444,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country,",,"saw her, he took her and lay with her by force."
24445,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and",,he loved the damsel.
24446,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor,",,"saying, Get me this damsel to wife."
24447,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with,,his cattle in the field:
24448,And Hamor the father of Shechem went,,"out to Jacob and said,"
24449,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem",,longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her to him in marriage.
24450,"And make ye marriages with us, and give your",,"daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
24451,And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before,,you.
24452,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace",,"in your eyes, and what you ask of me I will give."
24453,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according",,as you wish.
24454,And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father,,"with deceit, saying, ""We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be"
24455,"And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our",,sister to one of another nation.
24456,But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will,,"send some of your men with our own, that we may be instructed more perfectly in this matter."
24457,"Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters",,to us.
24458,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised;",,"behold, we will take your daughter, and we will go."
24459,"And their words pleased Hamor,",,and the men of the city.
24460,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in",,the Lord's commandments.
24461,And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of,,"their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
24462,"Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to",,be as one of us.
24463,Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be,,ours?
24464,And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of,,the sword.
24465,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and",,they plundered the city.
24466,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that",,"which was in their hand, and went out of the land of Egypt."
24467,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives",,were left behind as they fled into the night.
24468,"And they said, Should he deal with",,us according to our folly?
24469,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away",,"the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments."
24470,And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were,,"round about them, and they did not overtake them."
24471,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan,",,and he built an altar there and called it El-Bethel.
24472,"And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there",,"God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
24473,"But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel",,under the oak; therefore the name of it was called Allonbachuth.
24474,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he",,"came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him."
24475,"And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called",,"any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel."
24476,"And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will",,"give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
24477,And God went up from him in,,the place where he talked with him.
24478,And Jacob called the name of the,,place Peniel.
24479,And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way,,"to go to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."
24480,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the",,"midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
24481,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she",,died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
24482,"And Rachel died, and was buried in",,"the land of Canaan, in Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."
24483,And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that,,is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
24484,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his",,tent.
24485,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon,",,"Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun."
24486,The sons of Rachel;,,Joseph and Benjamin.
24487,"And the sons of Bilhah,",,were Dan and Naphtali.
24488,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are",,the sons of Jacob.
24489,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the",,"city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
24490,And the days of Isaac were,,one hundred and eighty years.
24491,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people,",,being old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
24492,Now these are the generations,,of Adam.
24493,Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon,,"the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite."
24494,"And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter,",,sister of Nebajoth.
24495,And Adah bare to Esau,,"Eliphaz, and Bashemath bare Reuel, and Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah."
24496,"And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons",,of Esau that were born unto him in Canaan.
24497,For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the,,"land could not bear them, that they might dwell together."
24498,Thus dwelt Esau in mount,,Seir.
24499,And these are the generations of Esau the,,father of the Edomites.
24500,These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the,,"wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau."
24501,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman,",,"Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz."
24502,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare,,Amalek to Eliphaz.
24503,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,",,and Mizzah.
24504,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of",,Zibeon.
24505,These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the,,"firstborn of Esau were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz."
24506,"Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came",,from the land of Edom.
24507,"And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah:",,"these were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah."
24508,"These are the sons of Esau, who",,are the Edomites.
24509,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited",,"the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan."
24510,"And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of",,"the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
24511,And the children of Lotan were Hori,,and Hemam.
24512,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan,",,"and Manahath, and Ebal, and Shepho, and Onam."
24513,And the children of Anah were these;,,"Dishon, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran."
24514,And these are the children of Dishon;,,"Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran."
24515,The children of Ezer are these;,,Bilhan and Jecuthiel.
24516,The children of Dishan are,,Esau and Edom.
24517,These are the dukes that came of the Horites;,,"Duke Lotan, Duke Shobal, Duke Zibeon, Duke Anah, Duke Dishon, Duke Ezer, and Duke Dish"
24518,"Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that",,arose from the Horites in the land of Seir.
24519,And these are the kings that reigned in the land of,,"Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
24520,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom:,,"and Hadad the son of Bedad, which smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead."
24521,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of",,Zerah of Bozrah became king in his place.
24522,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the",,land of Tema took his place.
24523,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field",,"of Moab, reigned in his stead."
24524,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of",,Mashrek took his place.
24525,"And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth",,by the river took his place.
24526,"And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son",,of Rechab reigned in his stead.
24527,"And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to",,"their families and their places, by their names: Duke Timna, Duke Alvah, Duke Jetheth, Duke Aholibamah,"
24528,"Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations",,in the land of their possession.
24529,And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father,,"was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
24530,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son",,of his old age.
24531,And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all,,"his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him."
24532,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it",,to his brethren.
24533,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray",,"you, and understand."
24534,And his brethren envied him; but,,his father observed the saying.
24535,And his brethren went to feed,,their father's flock in Shechem.
24536,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the",,flock in Shechem?
24537,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in",,"the wilderness, hungry and thirsty."
24538,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me,",,"I pray thee, where they be, and how it fareth with them."
24539,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for",,they were seen no more.
24540,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came",,"near, they began to mourn and weep."
24541,And they said one to,,"another, ""What shall we do?"""
24542,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of",,their hands.
24543,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped",,"Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours."
24544,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and",,"the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
24545,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it",,"if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?"
24546,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our",,"hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh."
24547,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was",,not in the pit.
24548,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The",,wine is found.
24549,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of",,"the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood."
24550,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an",,evil beast hath devoured him.
24551,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon",,his loins.
24552,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar,",,"an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard."
24553,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from",,"his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
24554,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name",,was Shua.
24555,"And she conceived, and bare a son;",,and called his name Joram.
24556,"And she conceived again, and bare a",,son.
24557,"And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his",,name Simeon.
24558,And Judah took a wife for Er,,"his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
24559,"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight",,of the LORD; so the LORD slew him.
24560,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife,",,and raise up seed unto thy brother.
24561,And the thing which he did displeased,,the Lord.
24562,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in",,law is coming up to thee.
24563,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be",,a prostitute.
24564,"And he said, I will send",,"my angel before you, to guard you on the way and bring you to the place which I have prepared."
24565,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail",,and put it in a safe place.
24566,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,",,to receive his pledge from the woman's hand.
24567,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was",,in the inn?
24568,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the",,"men of the place said, There was no harlot in this place."
24569,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be",,shamed.
24570,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than",,I.
24571,And it came to pass in the time of,,"the Judges, that there was a famine in the land."
24572,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet",,thread.
24573,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man;",,and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
24574,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that",,the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
24575,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him",,"overseer of his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
24576,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife",,"cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me."
24577,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that",,"he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
24578,"And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to",,do his work.
24579,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he",,"left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got out."
24580,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had",,"left his coat in her hand and was fled without it, that she called unto the men of her house, and said unto them,"
24581,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and",,"wept, that he said unto me, Why art thou weeping?"
24582,And she laid up his garment by,,her.
24583,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant,",,"whom thou hast bought of the Hebrews, hath come unto me; and, behold, he found me by this fountain, and he spake"
24584,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and",,"cried, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God."
24585,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place",,where the king's prisoners were bound.
24586,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave",,him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
24587,And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were,,in the prison.
24588,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king",,"of Egypt did remember Joseph, and spake of him unto Pharaoh."
24589,"And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the",,chief baker and the chief butler.
24590,And he put them in ward in the house of the captain,,of the guard.
24591,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and",,he put them in prison.
24592,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning,",,and he saw that they were sad.
24593,And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward,,to bring him a piece of bread.
24594,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said",,"to him, ""In my dream, behold, a vine was before me, and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it"
24595,"And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded,",,"and shot forth blossoms, and bare ripe grapes."
24596,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and",,"pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
24597,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation",,of it: The three branches are three days.
24598,For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and,,here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
24599,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I",,"also had a dream, and in my dream, there were three baskets of bread on my head."
24600,And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh;,,and the baker took the basket with the baked goods and presented it to Pharaoh.
24601,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the",,interpretation of it: The three trees are three days.
24602,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall",,hang thee on a tree.
24603,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership,,again.
24604,But he hanged the chief baker:,,for he had hanged himself.
24605,Yet did not the chief butler,,remember Joseph?
24606,And it came to pass at the end of two full,,years that Pharaoh dreamed.
24607,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well",,favoured kine and they fed in a meadow.
24608,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favored",,and lean fleshed.
24609,And the ill favored and leanfleshed kine did eat,,up the seven well favored and fat kine.
24610,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven",,"ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
24611,"And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with",,the east wind sprang up after them.
24612,And the seven thin ears devoured,,the seven fat ears.
24613,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying,",,"I remember when it was so, and there was none like it in all the land."
24614,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in",,the house of the captain of the guard.
24615,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he;",,"We dreamed that the world was young and fair, and all the stars were new."
24616,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it",,was.
24617,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the",,dungeon.
24618,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in",,me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
24619,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold,",,"I stood upon the bank of the river, and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well favored and fatflesh"
24620,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,",,well-favored and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
24621,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favored and",,"lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness."
24622,And the lean and the ill favored kine,,did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine.
24623,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they",,"had eaten them up, for they were still hungry."
24624,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven",,"fat cows came up out of the Nile, and they fed in a meadow."
24625,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted",,"with the east wind, sprang up after them."
24626,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this,,unto Pharaoh.
24627,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one:",,God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
24628,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven,,lean kine are seven years.
24629,This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh:,,"""Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me."""
24630,"Behold, there come seven years of great",,plenty.
24631,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall,,be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land.
24632,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by,,any means.
24633,And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the,,"thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
24634,Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and,,"wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
24635,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take",,up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years.
24636,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay",,"up stores of grain under Pharaoh's authority, and let them keep food in the cities."
24637,And the thing was good in the eyes of,,the Lord.
24638,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one",,"as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?"
24639,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all",,"this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou."
24640,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my",,people be ruled.
24641,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have",,set thee over all the land of Egypt.
24642,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no",,man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
24643,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him,,to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
24644,And in the seven plenteous years,,the land of Egypt did bring forth plentifully.
24645,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very",,"much, until he left numbering, for it was without number."
24646,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,",,which were Manasseh and Ephraim.
24647,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he,",,"hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
24648,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath,,caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
24649,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was",,"in the land of Egypt, came to an end."
24650,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy,,"corn, for the famine was sore in all lands."
24651,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob",,sent his sons to buy some.
24652,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you",,"down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
24653,And Joseph's ten brethren went down,,to buy corn in Egypt.
24654,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his",,brothers.
24655,And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those,,that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
24656,"And Joseph knew his brethren,",,but they knew not him.
24657,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them,",,Ye are spies: to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
24658,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord,",,but we will surely go down into the city.
24659,We are all one man's sons; we are,,all one woman's daughters.
24660,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see",,the kingdom of God.
24661,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that",,"I spoke unto you, saying, Ye are spies."
24662,Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye,,shall not go forth from this place except by my will.
24663,And he put them all,,in the box.
24664,"And Joseph said unto them the third day,",,"This do, and live; for I fear God:"
24665,"If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the",,"prison, and ye shall go and carry corn for your households."
24666,But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall,,"your words be verified, and ye shall not die."
24667,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against",,the child?
24668,And they knew not that Joseph understood them;,,for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
24669,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and",,spoke to them.
24670,And they laded their asses with,,the provisions and gifts.
24671,And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in,,"the stable, he found that his money was returned to him."
24672,And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of,,Canaan.
24673,"The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly",,"to his servants, demanding they obey his every command."
24674,"And we said unto him, We are",,true friends.
24675,"We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the",,"youngest is with our father, and one is not."
24676,And the famine was,,severe.
24677,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us,",,"saying, Except ye bring your brother also down with you, ye shall not see my face."
24678,"If thou wilt send our brother with us,",,we will go down and buy us food.
24679,"But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man",,"said unto us, Ye shall not see my face again, except your brother be with you."
24680,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as",,to steal away with me without my knowledge?
24681,"For except we had lingered, surely now",,we would have reached our destination by now.
24682,"Take also your brother, and arise,",,and go to the land of Canaan.
24683,"And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that",,he may deal kindly with you and let you go where you please.
24684,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand",,", and rose up early in the morning and went unto Egypt."
24685,And the man did as Joseph bade; and,,the man brought the donkey to Joseph.
24686,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and",,they spoke to him at the door of the house.
24687,"And said, O sir, we came indeed down",,to seek for help and guidance in this unfamiliar land.
24688,And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy,,food and provisions for the journey.
24689,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them",,"water to wash their feet, and gave them bread to eat."
24690,And they made ready the present against Joseph came at,,noon.
24691,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in",,"their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
24692,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father",,"well, the old man of whom ye spake?"
24693,"And they answered, Thy servant our father is",,"in good health, and behold, he is here."
24694,And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he,,"sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
24695,"And he washed his face, and went out,",,"and he washed his face, and went out, strengthened and resolved."
24696,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the",,youngest according to his youth.
24697,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food,",,"as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
24698,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the",,mouth of the sack.
24699,"As soon as the morning was light, the",,birds began to sing.
24700,"Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby",,he useth to know whether his wine be wholesome or not?
24701,"And he overtook them, and he",,"said unto them, ""Why are you weeping?"""
24702,"And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?",,"I seek no harm, but good to this people."
24703,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let",,"him die, and I will be thy servant."
24704,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with",,"whom I find shall be mine, and ye shall be free."
24705,Then they speedily took down every man his sack,,to the ground.
24706,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at",,the youngest.
24707,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every",,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every item into the moving truck."
24708,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he,,was still there.
24709,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?",,"Is it not this, that when I see your faces, I will remember you according to your deeds?"
24710,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have",,you prepared the feast as I commanded?
24711,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto",,"me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
24712,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father:",,"for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
24713,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come",,"down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
24714,And it came to pass when we came up unto thy,,"servant my father, that we told him the words of thy servant the king."
24715,"And our father said, Go again,",,and buy us a little food.
24716,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye",,"know that our wife is dead, and we have two sons by her."
24717,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely",,"going he goeth, and I shall see him no more."
24718,"And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him,",,then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
24719,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be",,"not with us, and his soul is bound up in the lad's soul,"
24720,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring",,"him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame for ever."
24721,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a",,bondservant to my lord.
24722,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not",,with me?
24723,And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians,,"heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard."
24724,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?",,And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
24725,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come",,"and let us go up to my father, and tell him of all God's goodness to us, and that we have found favour in the sight of"
24726,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold",,me into Egypt: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
24727,For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there,,"are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest."
24728,And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in,,"the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
24729,And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;,,"and I will provide for thee, and for thy household, and for all that thou hast."
24730,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother",,Esau see.
24731,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all",,that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
24732,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck,",,and wept.
24733,"Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon",,them.
24734,"And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's",,"brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
24735,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;",,"lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;"
24736,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of",,Egypt.
24737,Also regard not your stuff; for the good,,Also regard not your stuff; for the good shall come to you in due time.
24738,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according",,"to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
24739,To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to,,Joseph he gave a coat of many colors.
24740,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said",,"unto Joseph, See that thou bring thy brethren down unto me."
24741,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came",,into the land of Canaan.
24742,"And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and",,he is governor over all the land of Egypt.
24743,"And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet",,alive.
24744,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came",,to Beersheba.
24745,And God spake unto Israel in the visions,,"of the night, saying, Jacob, Jacob."
24746,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to",,go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation.
24747,I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely,,bring thee up again.
24748,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the",,"land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, they and all their household."
24749,"His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his",,daughters' daughters with him.
24750,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, which",,"came into Egypt; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, Dan"
24751,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch,",,"and Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
24752,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and",,"Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
24753,And the sons of Levi;,,"Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
24754,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola,",,"and Puah, Jashub, and Shimron."
24755,And the sons of Zebulun;,,"Seriah, Elon, and Jahleel."
24756,"These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his",,daughter Dinah.
24757,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi,",,"Shuni, and Ozni, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
24758,"And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,",,and Serah their sister.
24759,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah",,Gad and Asher.
24760,The sons of Rachel Jacob's,,were Joseph and Benjamin.
24761,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim,",,which the Lord gave him.
24762,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,",,"Ehud, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh."
24763,"These are the sons of Rachel, which were",,born to Jacob: Joseph and Benjamin.
24764,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel,",,"and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
24765,"These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his",,daughter.
24766,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of",,"his loins, were seventy."
24767,"And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all",,"the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten."
24768,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his",,way before him to Goshen.
24769,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since",,"I have seen your face, and it is well with you."
24770,"And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and",,they have brought their flocks and their herds with them.
24771,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall",,"call for you and say, ""What is your occupation?"""
24772,"And he took some of his brethren, even",,"of the children of Ephraim, and went up to the house of God."
24773,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said",,"We are shepherds, and have been all our days."
24774,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father",,and thy brethren are come unto thee:
24775,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and",,set him before Pharaoh.
24776,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob,",,How old art thou?
24777,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and",,went out from Pharaoh.
24778,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all",,"his father's household with bread, according to their families."
24779,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will",,give you for your cattle.
24780,And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every,,"man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's."
24781,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one",,to another.
24782,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your",,land for Pharaoh.
24783,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace",,"in thy sight, and we will surely be thy servants."
24784,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of",,Goshen.
24785,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the,,"days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years."
24786,"And he said,",,"""I'll be back."""
24787,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy",,father is sick.
24788,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh",,unto thee.
24789,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me",,"at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
24790,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and",,shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
24791,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons,",,"and said, ""Who are these?"""
24792,Now the eyes of Israel were dim for,,"age, so that he could not see well."
24793,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see",,"thy face: and lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed."
24794,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and",,"he fell on their necks, and wept upon them."
24795,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and",,Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand.
24796,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac",,"did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,"
24797,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for",,this is he that shall rule over all his brethren.
24798,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God",,make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.
24799,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be",,"with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
24800,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took",,out of the portion of Ephraim.
24801,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I",,may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
24802,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of",,"Jacob, and hearken unto Israel your father."
24803,"Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of",,"my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power."
24804,"Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy",,father's bed; then defiledst thou that which should not be defiled: thou shalt surely die.
24805,Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments,,of cruelty are in their habitations.
24806,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it",,was cruel.
24807,"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in",,the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
24808,"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet,",,until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
24809,"Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine;",,"he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes."
24810,"His eyes shall be red with wine,",,and his teeth white with age.
24811,Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be,,for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Sidon.
24812,Issachar is a strong ass,,crouching between two burdens.
24813,"And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was",,pleasant.
24814,"Dan shall judge his people, as",,he is their leader.
24815,"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path,",,"that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward."
24816,I have waited for,,you for so long.
24817,"Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but",,"his own hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him."
24818,Out of Asher his bread shall be,,fat.
24819,Naphtali is a hind let,,loose.
24820,"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough",,by a well; whose branches run over the wall.
24821,"The archers have sorely grieved him, and",,struck him through with arrows.
24822,Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall,,devour the prey.
24823,All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father,,"spoke unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
24824,There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried,,Isaac and Rebekah his wife; there they buried Jacob and Leah his wife.
24825,The purchase of the field and of the cave,,was a significant investment for the community.
24826,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his",,feet into the bed.
24827,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face,",,"and wept upon him, and kissed him."
24828,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to,,embalm his father.
24829,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of,,those who are anointed.
24830,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy",,father.
24831,"And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their",,"little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
24832,And there went up with him both chariots and,,horses.
24833,And his sons did unto him,,according to all that he had commanded them.
24834,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went",,"with him, as Pharaoh had commanded."
24835,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure",,"hate us, and will surely requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
24836,"And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying,",,"""Thy father was in good health when he sent us, and he said, 'Say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now,"
24837,And his brethren also went and fell down before his,,face.
24838,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for",,am I in the place of God?
24839,"But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good,",,"to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."
24840,Now therefore fear ye not: I will,,now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you and your little ones.
24841,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's",,household.
24842,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also,,of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
24843,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will",,"surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
24844,"So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they",,"embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
24845,"Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which",,came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
24846,And all the souls that came out of the loins of,,Esau were Edomites.
24847,"And Joseph died, and all his",,brethren.
24848,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied,",,and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
24849,Now there arose up a new king,,"over Egypt, which knew not Joseph."
24850,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of",,the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
24851,Therefore they did set over them taskmasters,,to afflict them with burdens.
24852,"But the more they afflicted them,",,the more they multiplied and grew.
24853,And the Egyptians made the children,,of Israel to serve with rigor.
24854,"And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the",,"name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:"
24855,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king",,"of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive."
24856,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,",,"Why do you fear God, and do not do as I command?"
24857,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian",,"women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them."
24858,Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and,,"the people multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty."
24859,"And it came to pass, because the midwives",,"feared God, that he made them houses."
24860,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye",,"shall cast into the river, but every daughter ye shall save."
24861,And there went a man of the house of,,Levi.
24862,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw",,"him, that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months."
24863,"And his sister stood afar off, to",,see what would happen.
24864,"And when she had opened it, she saw",,"a small, intricately carved wooden box inside."
24865,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee",,"a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
24866,And Pharaoh's daughter said,,"""Is this not the son of one of the Hebrew women?"""
24867,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there",,"was no one about, he slipped away quickly."
24868,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove",,"together; and he said to him that did the wrong, ""Why do you strike your companion?"""
24869,Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and,,"drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock."
24870,And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses,,"stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
24871,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How",,is it that ye are come so soon to day?
24872,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the",,"shepherds, and also brought us water, and watered the flock."
24873,"And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it",,that ye have left the man?
24874,And Moses was content to dwell with the,,"man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah."
24875,"And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom:",,"for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land."
24876,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his",,"covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
24877,And God looked upon the children of,,"men, and saw that they were very wicked and sinful."
24878,"And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see",,"this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
24879,"And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from",,"thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground."
24880,"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto",,me.
24881,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou",,mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
24882,"And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,",,and bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
24883,"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt",,"thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you."
24884,And I am sure that the king of Egypt will,,not let you go.
24885,"And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which",,I will do in the midst thereof.
24886,And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and,,"it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty."
24887,"And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken",,"unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee."
24888,"And the LORD said unto him, What is that",,in thy hand?
24889,"And he said, Cast",,it into the sea.
24890,"That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of",,"Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto me."
24891,"And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the",,"dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Have not I the LORD?"
24892,"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy",,"mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say."
24893,"And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee,",,by another.
24894,And thou shalt take this rod in,,thy hand.
24895,"And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into",,Egypt.
24896,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the",,"Lord, Let my people go."
24897,"And it came to pass by the way in the inn,",,that the LORD met him and sought to kill him.
24898,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and",,"cast it at Moses' feet, and said, ""Surely you are a husband of blood to me!"""
24899,"So he let him go: then she said, A",,A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
24900,"And the LORD said to Aaron, Go",,into the wilderness to meet Moses.
24901,And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had,,"sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him to do."
24902,And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together,,all the elders of the children of Israel.
24903,And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto,,Moses.
24904,"And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to",,let Israel go?
24905,"And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and",,"Aaron, let the people from their works?"
24906,"And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now",,"are many, and we are but few."
24907,And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters,,"and officers over the people, saying,"
24908,"Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick,",,as they have done heretofore.
24909,"Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they",,may not have time to idle.
24910,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake",,"to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw."
24911,"Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it:",,for there shall no more be given you.
24912,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the,,earth.
24913,"And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works,",,"your daily tasks, make no delay."
24914,Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried,,"unto Pharaoh, saying, ""Why do you deal thus with your servants?"
24915,"There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick:",,"and behold, there is no straw given to us, yet they require of us that we make brick."
24916,"But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye",,shall not eat of my bread.
24917,"Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be",,given you.
24918,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in",,the way to meet them.
24919,"And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so",,ill entreated this people?
24920,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath",,done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
24921,"And God spake unto Moses, and said",,"""I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."""
24922,"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of",,"God Almighty, but by my name LORD was I not known to them."
24923,"And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the",,"land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they lived as sojourners."
24924,"And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,",,whom the Egyptians keep in bondage.
24925,And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened,,not unto Moses for sore bondage.
24926,And the LORD spake,,"unto Moses, saying,"
24927,"Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he",,let my people go.
24928,"And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not",,"hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?"
24929,These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn,,"of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi."
24930,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar,",,and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
24931,"The sons of Gershon; Libni, and",,Shimei.
24932,"And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the",,"sons of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam."
24933,And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these,,are the families of the Merarites.
24934,And the sons of Izhar;,,"Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
24935,And the sons of Uzziel;,,"Micah, and Ishiah."
24936,"And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to",,wife.
24937,"And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and",,Abiasaph.
24938,"These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out",,my people Israel from Egypt.
24939,"These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out",,the children of Israel from his land.
24940,And it came to pass on the day when the,,"Lord spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting, saying,"
24941,"That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak",,"unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God."
24942,"And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of",,uncircumcised lips.
24943,"And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a",,god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
24944,Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak,,"unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land."
24945,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my",,signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
24946,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth",,"my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them."
24947,And Moses and Aaron did as the,,Lord commanded them.
24948,"And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore",,and three years old when they spake unto Pharaoh.
24949,And the LORD spake unto,,"Moses, saying,"
24950,Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the,,"magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments."
24951,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they",,became serpents.
24952,"And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened",,not unto them; as the LORD had said.
24953,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is",,hardened.
24954,"And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall",,"stink, and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river."
24955,And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart,,was hardened.
24956,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither",,did he regard this.
24957,And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to,,drink.
24958,"And seven days were fulfilled, after that",,the Lord had created the heavens and the earth.
24959,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,",,"Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
24960,"And if thou refuse to let them go, behold,",,I will smite thy borders with frogs.
24961,"And the frogs shall come up both on thee,",,"and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants."
24962,And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;,,"and all the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt."
24963,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and",,brought forth frogs upon the land of Egypt.
24964,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from",,"thy servants, and from thy people."
24965,And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto,,the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.
24966,And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died,,"out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields."
24967,And they gathered them together upon,,a heap.
24968,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his",,heart.
24969,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but",,they could not.
24970,"Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's",,"heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said."
24971,And I will put a division between my people,,and the people of the land.
24972,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said,",,"""Go, sacrifice to your God in the land."""
24973,"We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice",,to our gods as we have promised.
24974,And Moses went out from,,"Pharaoh, and called to all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and"
24975,And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms,,"of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one."
24976,And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time,,and would not let the people go.
24977,"Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith",,"the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
24978,For if thou refuse to let them,,"go, behold, I will smite thy fields with locusts."
24979,And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of,,Egypt.
24980,"And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow",,the LORD will do this thing in the land.
24981,"And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of",,Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
24982,And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils;,,"for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians."
24983,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened",,not unto them; as the LORD had said unto Moses.
24984,"For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and",,thy people with boils.
24985,"And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show",,"in thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth."
24986,"As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people,",,that thou wilt not let them go?
24987,"Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous",,hailstorm upon the earth.
24988,He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of,,"Saul, when he heard the word of the LORD, was afraid."
24989,And he that regarded not the word of the LORD,,spoke it in contempt.
24990,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there",,was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
24991,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the",,"Israelites lived, were they spared from the plagues."
24992,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have",,"sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked."
24993,Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings,,"and rain, or we shall all perish."
24994,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know",,that ye will not fear the Lord God.
24995,And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the,,"barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled."
24996,But the wheat and the rye were not,,affected by the drought.
24997,And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were,,"ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
24998,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the",,people go.
24999,"Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold,",,I will send swarms of flies upon thee.
25000,"And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them,",,"""Go, sacrifice to your God in the land."""
25001,"And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will",,be with you this day.
25002,"Not so: go now ye that are men, and",,serve the Lord your God.
25003,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,",,"""I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you."""
25004,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the",,LORD thy God that he may also take away from me this death.
25005,And he went out from,,there.
25006,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he",,would not let the children of Israel go.
25007,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there",,"may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt"
25008,And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was,,a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
25009,"They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three",,hours.
25010,"And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your",,flocks and your herds be left behind.
25011,"And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt",,"offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God."
25012,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and",,he would not let the children of Israel go.
25013,"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my",,face no more.
25014,"And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I",,will do this thing.
25015,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his",,"neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
25016,"And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight",,I will go out into the midst of Egypt:
25017,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such",,"as there has never been before, nor shall there be such again."
25018,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;",,"that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by"
25019,And the LORD spake unto Moses and,,"Aaron, saying,"
25020,This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it,,shall be the first month of the year to you.
25021,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:",,"you shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats."
25022,And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and,,the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
25023,"And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts",,"and on the upper door post of the house, wherein they shall eat it."
25024,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,",,and unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
25025,"Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast",,it with fire; its head with its entrails.
25026,And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that,,which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
25027,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall",,keep the passover.
25028,Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all,,your dwellings ye shall eat unleavened bread.
25029,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw",,"out and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover."
25030,And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance,,to your generations forever.
25031,"And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the",,"Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set the one tribe on the top of mount Gerizim, and the other on the top"
25032,"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall",,"say to you, What mean ye by this service?"
25033,"And the children of Israel went away, and did as",,the LORD had commanded them.
25034,"Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye",,have said.
25035,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out",,of the land.
25036,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their",,kneading bowls being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
25037,And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they,,"borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment."
25038,And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the,,Egyptians.
25039,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about",,"six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children."
25040,And a mixed multitude went up also with them;,,"and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle."
25041,"Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who",,"dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years."
25042,"And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the",,ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof.
25043,"But every man's servant that is bought for money, when",,"he is set free, shall go out with nothing."
25044,A foreigner and an hired,,A foreigner and a hired hand.
25045,In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of,,the flesh abroad out of the house.
25046,All the congregation of,,the children of Israel shall keep it.
25047,"One law shall be to him that is homeborn,",,and to the stranger that sojourns among you.
25048,Thus did all the children of Israel; as the,,"LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they."
25049,"And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring",,the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
25050,"Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the",,"children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine."
25051,This day came ye out,,of the house of bondage.
25052,"Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the",,seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.
25053,Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen,,"with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters."
25054,"And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of",,that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.
25055,Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in,,its appointed season from year to year.
25056,And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the,,"Canaan, which he sware unto thy fathers, and to their seed, to give them, a land that floweth with milk and honey"
25057,"That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every",,firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males thereof shall be the LORD'S.
25058,"And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine",,eyes.
25059,"But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red",,Sea.
25060,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped",,"in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness."
25061,"He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day,",,nor the pillar of fire by night.
25062,"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol",,"and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: there shall ye pitch your camp by the sea."
25063,"For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are",,confused in the land.
25064,"And he made ready his chariot,",,"and took his bow in his hand,"
25065,"And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the",,"chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them."
25066,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after",,the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.
25067,"But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his",,"horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon"
25068,"The LORD shall fight for you,",,and ye shall hold your peace.
25069,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?",,"speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward."
25070,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have",,"gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen."
25071,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst",,"of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen."
25072,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the",,"waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."
25073,Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of,,the Egyptians.
25074,And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and,,"the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses."
25075,The LORD is a man of,,war.
25076,Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea:,,his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.
25077,The depths have covered them: they sank,,"into the abyss, never to be seen again."
25078,"Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy",,"right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy."
25079,And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose,,up against thee.
25080,"And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood",,"upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea."
25081,"Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered",,"them, and they sank like lead in the mighty waters."
25082,"Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who",,"is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
25083,Thou stretchedst out thy right,,hand and the earth swallowed them.
25084,Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast,,redeemed.
25085,"The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow",,shall come upon them suddenly.
25086,"Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling",,shall take hold upon them; and all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
25087,The LORD shall reign,,for ever and ever.
25088,"And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand;",,and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
25089,"And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed",,gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
25090,"So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness",,of Shur.
25091,"And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of",,"Marah, for they were bitter."
25092,"And the people murmured against Moses,",,"saying, ""Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?"""
25093,"And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and",,threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
25094,And the whole congregation of the children of Israel,,"shouted with a great shout, that the rock was rent, and the water came out."
25095,"And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that",,which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
25096,"And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye",,shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt.
25097,"And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children",,"of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings."
25098,"And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered",,the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
25099,"And the children of Israel did so,",,and they were obedient to the voice of the Lord their God.
25100,"And Moses said, Let no man",,"put on his shoe upon his foot, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground."
25101,Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until,,the morning.
25102,"And they gathered it every morning, every man according to",,his need.
25103,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade:",,"and it bred worms, and stank."
25104,"And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath",,unto the LORD; to day ye shall not find it in the field.
25105,"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,",,"which is the Sabbath, there will be none."
25106,"And it came to pass, that there went out some of the",,people of the city into the fields to gather herbs.
25107,"And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse",,ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
25108,So the people rested,,after their long journey.
25109,And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like,,"coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey."
25110,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna",,"therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations."
25111,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid",,"them before the Testimony, as a memorial."
25112,Now an omer is the,,"unit of measure used in the Bible, equivalent to about 2 liters or 0.5 gallons."
25113,"And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do",,unto this people?
25114,"Then came Amalek, and fought",,with Israel at Rephidim.
25115,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:",,"and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
25116,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that",,"Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
25117,And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people,,with the edge of the sword.
25118,"And Moses built an altar, and",,called it Jehovah-nissi.
25119,"For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the",,"LORD will have no mercy on thee, nor pity thee, nor have compassion on thee, but will destroy thee."
25120,"Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah,",,"Moses' wife, and her two sons, and came to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped."
25121,And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;,,"for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land:"
25122,"And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father,",,"said Abraham, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."
25123,"And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife",,unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of God.
25124,"And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am",,"come to see thee, and thy wife, and thy sons, and I have brought them unto thee into the wilderness."
25125,"And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed",,him.
25126,And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to,,Israel his people.
25127,Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for,,"in the day when he shows himself mighty, he delivers his people."
25128,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the",,people.
25129,"And Moses said unto his father in law, Because",,the LORD our God is a jealous God.
25130,"When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and",,"another, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws."
25131,"And Moses' father in law said unto him,",,"I will now go my way, for it is not well that I should leave thee."
25132,"And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the",,"way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do."
25133,"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be",,blessed.
25134,So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father,,and went out.
25135,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the",,"people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
25136,And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes,,they judged in the gate.
25137,And Moses let his father in law depart; and,,he went his way into his own land.
25138,"In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of",,"the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sin."
25139,"For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai,",,and had pitched their tents before the mountain.
25140,"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how",,I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you unto myself.
25141,And ye shall be unto me a,,"kingdom of priests, and a holy nation."
25142,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and",,set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him.
25143,"And all the people answered together, and said, All",,that the LORD hath spoken we will do.
25144,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify",,"them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes."
25145,And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD,,will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
25146,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people,",,and he took the two tables of the testimony in his hand.
25147,"And he said unto the people, Be ready against",,the third day: for the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
25148,And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet,,God.
25149,"And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder",,"and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice."
25150,"And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and",,"the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount, and Moses went up."
25151,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they",,"break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish."
25152,"And let the priests also, which come near to the",,"And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them."
25153,"And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai:",,"for the LORD hath charged us, saying, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye touch the border of it, lest ye die."
25154,So Moses went down unto the,,"people, and spake unto them."
25155,And God spake all,,"these words, saying,"
25156,"I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out",,"of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
25157,Thou shalt have no,,other gods before me.
25158,And showing mercy unto thousands of them,,that love me and keep my commandments.
25159,Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for,,the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
25160,"Remember the sabbath day,",,to keep it holy.
25161,"Six days shalt thou labor,",,and do all thy work.
25162,Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be,,long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
25163,Thou shalt not bear false,,witness against thy neighbor.
25164,"And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will",,hear.
25165,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove",,"you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not."
25166,"And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew",,near to the thick darkness where God was.
25167,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children",,"of Israel, I am the LORD your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
25168,"Ye shall not make with me gods of silver,",,neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
25169,Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine,,"altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."
25170,Now these are the judgments which,,thou shalt set before them.
25171,"If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve:",,and in the seventh he shall go out free.
25172,"If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself:",,"if he came in with others, he shall be rescued from them."
25173,"And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master,",,"my wife, and my children; I will not go out free."
25174,And if a man sell his daughter to be a,,"maid servant, she shall not go out as the menservants do."
25175,"And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he",,shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
25176,"If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment,",,and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.
25177,"And if he do not these three unto her,",,then she shall go out free without money.
25178,"He that smiteth a man, so that he",,"die, shall be surely put to death."
25179,"And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into",,his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
25180,"But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with",,"guile, thou shalt take him from mine altar that he may die."
25181,"And he that smiteth his father, or his",,"mother, shall surely be put to death."
25182,"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he",,"be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."
25183,"And he that curseth his father, or his",,"mother, shall surely be put to death."
25184,"And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,",,"or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed:"
25185,"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a",,"rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished."
25186,"Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he",,will likely recover.
25187,"And if any mischief follow, then",,shall the guilty one be held responsible.
25188,"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,",,"hand for hand, foot for foot."
25189,"Burning for burning, wound for",,"wound, tooth for tooth."
25190,"And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his",,"maid, that it be destroyed, he shall let him go free for his eye's sake."
25191,"And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's",,"tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake."
25192,"If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall",,pay it.
25193,"Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,",,the ox shall be stoned.
25194,If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give,,thirty shekels of silver unto their master.
25195,"And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig",,"a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;"
25196,"The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money",,to the owner of the animal.
25197,"If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell",,"it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep."
25198,"If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that",,"he die, there shall no blood be shed for him."
25199,"If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether",,"it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall restore double."
25200,"If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought",,"to the judges, and he shall swear that he has not laid his hand upon his neighbor's goods."
25201,"And if it be stolen from him, he",,shall make restitution.
25202,"If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for",,a witness.
25203,"And if a man borrow ought of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or",,"die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good."
25204,"But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it",,good.
25205,"And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and",,"lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife."
25206,"If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him,",,he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
25207,Thou shalt not suffer,,a witch to live.
25208,Whosoever lieth with a beast shall,,surely be put to death.
25209,"He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto",,"the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed."
25210,"Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him:",,for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
25211,Ye shall not afflict any,,widow or fatherless child.
25212,"If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry",,"at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry."
25213,"And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with",,the sword.
25214,"If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou",,"shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury."
25215,"If thou at all take thy neighbor's raiment to pledge, thou",,shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down.
25216,"Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor",,curse the ruler of thy people.
25217,"Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and",,thy liquors.
25218,"Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it",,shall be with its dam; and on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
25219,And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that,,is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
25220,Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine,,hand to do evil.
25221,Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou,,speak in a cause to turn away after many to pervert judgment.
25222,Neither shalt thou countenance a,,neither shalt thou countenance a liar.
25223,If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going,,"astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again."
25224,If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his,,"burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him."
25225,Thou shalt not wrest the judgment,,of any man.
25226,Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and,,righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
25227,And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth,,"the wise, and perverteth the ways of judgment."
25228,Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart,,"of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt."
25229,"And six years thou shalt sow thy land,",,and thou shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
25230,Three times thou shalt keep a,,Three times thou shalt keep a silence.
25231,Three items in the year all thy,,Three items in the year all thy days shall be kept.
25232,Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;,,neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
25233,The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt,,bring into the house of the LORD thy God.
25234,"Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the",,"way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared."
25235,"Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he",,will not pardon your transgressions.
25236,"But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then",,"I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries."
25237,"Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after",,their works.
25238,"And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread,",,and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
25239,"There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in",,in all the land.
25240,"I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom",,thou shalt come.
25241,"And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out",,"the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee."
25242,I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest,,"the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee."
25243,By little and little I will drive them out from,,before you.
25244,Thou shalt make no covenant with,,"them, nor show mercy unto them."
25245,"They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:",,"for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee."

26414,"And when Moses heard it,",,he was angry.
26415,"This do; Take you censers,",,"This do; Take you censers, and go into the court of the congregation, and let them burn incense with you."

26423,"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that",,I may consume them in a moment.
26424,"Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from",,"around this place, and move forward."
26425,And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and,,Abiram.
26426,"And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to",,do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own heart.
26427,"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be",,"visited with the common fate, then we shall know that it was not by the hand of God."

26433,"Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers",,"out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed."
26434,"And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had",,offered; for they were made broad at the bottom for a covering of the altar.
26435,But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against,,"Moses and Aaron, saying, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt!"
26436,And Moses and Aaron came before,,Pharaoh.
26437,"Get you up from among this congregation, that",,I may consume them in a moment.
26438,And he stood between the dead and,,the living.
26439,Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and,,seven hundred.
26440,And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the,,tabernacle of the congregation.
26441,And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one,,rod shall be for each father's house.
26442,And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the,,"congregation, before the testimony, where I will meet with thee."
26443,And Moses laid up the rods before,,the Lord.

26466,And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and,,the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until the even.
26467,And there was no water for the congregation: and,,they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

26471,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto",,"them, ""Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?"""
26472,"And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice:",,and the water came out abundantly.
26473,This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel,,"strived with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them."
26474,"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith",,"thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us."
26475,"How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in",,Egypt a long time.

26477,"And he said, Thou",,shalt not kill.
26478,Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through,,his territory.
26479,"And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,",,went their way from the mount of the LORD three days' journey.
26480,And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount,,"Sinai, saying,"
26481,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and",,bring them to the tent of meeting.
26482,"And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son:",,"and anoint him, and consecrate him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office."
26483,And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up,,"into the mount of God, both of them together."
26484,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they",,"mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel."
26485,"And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed",,"deliver me out of the hand of the Philistines, then I will devote to thee the first-born that cometh forth from my body."
26486,"And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and",,they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.
26487,And the children of Israel set,,out from Rameses to Succoth.
26488,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in",,the border of Moab.
26489,"From thence they removed, and pitched",,in the wilderness of Sin.

26493,"Then Israel sang this song, Spring up,",,"O well! Spring up, O well!"
26494,"The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged",,it with their own hands.
26495,And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:,,and from Nahaliel to Bamoth.
26496,"And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country",,"of Moab, to Dibon."
26497,And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon,,"king of the Amorites, saying,"
26498,And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the,,cities of the Amorites.
26499,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,",,let the city of Sihon be built and established.
26500,"Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his",,"sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity."
26501,"We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and",,we have laid waste the land with a mighty hand.
26502,Thus Israel dwelt in the,,land of Goshen.
26503,"And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the",,"villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there."
26504,"So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until",,there was none left to resist them.
26505,"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in",,the wilderness of Sin.
26506,And Balak the son of Zippor saw all,,that the children of Israel had done to the Amorites.
26507,"And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were",,many.
26508,"And God came unto Balaam, and said,",,"""Rise up, and go with them; but only the word which I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou do."""
26509,"And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of",,"Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,"
26510,"And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them;",,thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
26511,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went",,with their sheep and their cattle to meet Balaam.
26512,"And Balak sent yet again princes,",,more numerous and more honourable than they.
26513,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son",,"of Zippor: Come, I pray thee, curse me this people."
26514,"For I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do whatsoever",,thou desirest.
26515,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that",,I may do you a kindness.
26516,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled",,"his ass, and went with the princes of Moab."
26517,"But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards,",,a narrow place between the rows of vines.
26518,"And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto",,the wall.
26519,"And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where",,there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
26520,"And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under",,Balaam.
26521,"And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam,",,"""What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?"""
26522,"And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would",,"there were a sword in mine hand, for now I would slay thee."
26523,"And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had",,"turned aside from me, surely now I had also killed thee, and I had let her live."
26524,"And Balaam went with Balak,",,and they came to the high places of Baal.
26525,"And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to",,"Balaam, saying, ""Come, curse this people for me."""
26526,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars,",,and bring me here seven bulls and seven rams.
26527,And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and,,Balaam went together.
26528,"And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven",,"altars, and I have offered upon each altar a bull and a ram."
26529,"And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and",,"said, Go say unto Balak, Thus saith the LORD."
26530,"And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by",,the altar of burnt offering.
26531,"How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or",,"how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?"
26532,"And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took",,"thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them."
26533,"And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to",,speak and act with caution?
26534,"And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,",,"and he showed him all the land, from Gilead to Dan."
26535,"And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy",,"burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee"
26536,"And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his",,"mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus."
26537,"And when he came to him, behold, he stood by",,the altar.
26538,"And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up,",,"O ye princes, and hear; give ear, all ye of the earth."
26539,"Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and",,he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
26540,"He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the",,"LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them."
26541,God brought them out of Egypt; he hath,,done great things for them.
26542,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them",,"at all, nor bless them."
26543,"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,",,"saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that will I do?"
26544,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another",,"place, that peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse them for me."
26545,And Balak brought Balaam unto the top,,"of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon."
26546,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered",,a burnt offering on the top of every one.
26547,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his",,tents.
26548,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of",,"Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:"
26549,"He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision",,"of the great glory, which was with us in the wilderness."
26550,"How goodly are thy tents, O",,"Jacob, thy dwellings, O Israel!"
26551,Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto,,"great things, but now it cannot be."
26552,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also",,"to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,"
26553,"And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise",,thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

26557,"Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until",,Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

26559,"And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict",,"Assyria, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall fall at the last."

26561,"And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began",,to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
26562,And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:,,and the people came together to eat and drink and rise up to play.
26563,And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the,,anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.

26883,"And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which",,"came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead."
26884,And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth,,"to Sihon king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,"
26885,Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high,,way and will not turn aside into thy fields.
26886,"Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water",,for I am thirsty.
26887,"And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and",,"his land before thee; begin to inherit, that thou mayest possess his land."
26888,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and",,"all his people, to battle at Jahaz."
26889,And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and,,"we saw it, and our hearts did melt."
26890,"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and",,"the women, and the little ones, and left none to remain."
26891,"Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves,",,and all the cities we burned with fire.
26892,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of",,"Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
26893,"So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan,",,"and all his people, and we smote him until none was left to him remaining."
26894,"All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates,",,and watchtowers.
26895,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of",,Heshbon.
26896,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the",,"cities, they took for a prey unto themselves."
26897,(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;,,and the Amorites call it Senir;)
26898,"All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,",,"unto the borders of Jazer, and unto the sea of Chinnereth,"
26899,Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of,,Geshur and Maachath.
26900,"The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto",,"the salt sea, toward the going down of the sun."
26901,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that",,you have much cattle) shall remain in the cities of Gilead.
26902,Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD,,"your God is with you, to fight for you against them."
26903,And I besought the LORD,,"at that time, saying,"
26904,"I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good",,"land beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."
26905,"But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before",,"this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see."
26906,So we abode in the,,"village for a while, living off the land and the kindness of the locals."
26907,Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the,,"men who followed Baalpeor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you."
26908,But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your,,"God, ye are all alive this day."
26909,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded",,"me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it."
26910,"For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as",,the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?
26911,"And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so",,righteous as all this law which I set before you this day?
26912,And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned,,"with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness."
26913,And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard,,"the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice."
26914,"And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform,",,"even the ten commandments, and wrote them upon two tables of stone."
26915,"And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that",,you might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
26916,"Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the",,"form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
26917,"The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the",,"likeness of any creeping thing that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any living creature that moves in the water, or the likeness of"
26918,"The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness",,"of any living creature that moveth upon all fours, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters under the earth, the likeness of any bird"
26919,"But I must die in this land, I must not go over",,the border.
26920,For the LORD thy God is a,,"consuming fire, a jealous God."
26921,"And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be",,"left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you."
26922,"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood",,and stone.
26923,"But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find",,"him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul."
26924,"(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither",,"destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
26925,Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of,,"the fire, as you have heard it, and live?"
26926,"Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that the",,Lord he is God; there is none else besides him.
26927,"And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and",,brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power.
26928,"To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring",,"thee into their land, to give it thee for an inheritance."
26929,"Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he",,"is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else."
26930,Then Moses severed three cities on,,the other side of the Jordan.
26931,"That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him",,not in times past.
26932,"Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and",,"Ramoth in Gilead, and Jazer in Gilead."
26933,And this is the law which Moses,,set before the children of Israel.
26934,"These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake",,"unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt."
26935,"And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two",,kings of the Amorites.
26936,"From Aroer, which is by the bank of the",,"river Arnon, even to Gilead, there was not a city too great for us."
26937,"And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto",,"the sea of the plain, over against the going down of the sun, shall be your coast."
26938,The LORD our God made a,,covenant with us.
26939,"The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,",,"even us, who are all of us here alive this day."
26940,The LORD talked with you face to face in,,the mount out of the midst of the fire.
26941,"I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out",,"of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
26942,Thou shalt have none,,other gods before me.
26943,Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for,,the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
26944,"Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as",,the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.
26945,"Six days thou shalt labor,",,and on the seventh day thou shalt rest.
26946,Neither shalt thou bear false,,witness against thy neighbor.
26947,Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we,,"hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die."
26948,"For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living",,God as we have?
26949,"Go say to them, Get",,out.
26950,Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you:,,ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
26951,"Hear, O Israel: The LORD",,"our God, the LORD is one."
26952,And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine,,"heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might."
26953,"And these words, which I command thee",,"this day, shall be in thy heart."
26954,And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine,,"hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes."
26955,And thou shalt write them upon the posts,,"of thy house, and on thy gates."
26956,"Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth",,"out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
26957,"Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and",,serve him only.
26958,"Ye shall not go after other gods, of the",,gods of the people which are round about you.
26959,Ye shall not tempt the LORD your,,God.
26960,"Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,",,"and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded you."
26961,To cast out all thine enemies from,,the land.
26962,"And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies,",,"and the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord our God commanded you?"
26963,"Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt;",,"and when the LORD saw us, he delivered us from the hand of the Egyptians."
26964,"And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon",,Egypt.
26965,"And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us",,in to the land which he sware unto our fathers.
26966,"And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all",,"these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us."
26967,Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give,,"unto his son, neither shalt thou take his daughter unto thy son."
26968,"But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down",,"their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire."
26969,"The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were",,more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people.
26970,"And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not",,"be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face."
26971,"Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the",,judgments.
26972,Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be,,"male nor female barren among you, nor any of thy cattle."
26973,"If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations",,"are greater than I, how can I dispossess them?"
26974,Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what,,"the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt."
26975,"Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until",,"they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed."
26976,Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD,,"thy God is with thee, to fight for thee against them, and to save thee."
26977,"But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and",,shall smite them with a mighty destruction.
26978,"Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither",,"did thy foot swell, these forty years."
26979,"Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man",,"is not born of himself, so neither can he live to himself alone."
26980,Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy,,"God, and walk in his ways, and fear him."
26981,"For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of",,"brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;"
26982,"A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig",,"trees, and pomegranates, and olive oil, and honey."
26983,"When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the",,Lord thy God.
26984,"Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his",,"commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day."
26985,"Lest when thou hast eaten and art full,",,"thou say, ""Who hath filled me?"""
26986,"And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and",,"thy gold is multiplied, then take heed to thy soul, lest thou forget the Lord thy God."
26987,"Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which",,"brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
26988,"And thou say in thine heart, My power and the",,might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.
26989,"As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish;",,because ye have not hearkened unto the voice of the LORD your God.
26990,"Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to",,"possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,"
26991,"A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and",,of whom thou hast heard.
26992,"Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land",,"to eat and to drink of its abundance, but to keep his commandments, to walk in his ways, and to fear him all the days of"
26993,"Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that",,the LORD was angry with you to destroy you.
26994,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that",,"the LORD said unto Moses, ""Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a"
26995,"Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen",,"this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people."
26996,"Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under",,heaven.
26997,"So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with",,fire.
26998,"And I took the two tables, and cast them out",,"of my hands, and broke them before your eyes."
26999,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure,",,which might come upon me from my lord.
27000,And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed,,"him, but Moses prayed for Aaron, and the LORD hearkened to the voice of Moses."
27001,"And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at",,Kibroth-hattaavah.
27002,Ye have been rebellious against the LORD,,from the day that I knew you.
27003,"Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I",,"fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I did also when the LORD spoke of destroying you."
27004,"Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness",,"of their heart, nor to their sins: but let thy tender mercies speedily precede them."
27005,"Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest",,"forth out of Egypt, out of the iron furnace."
27006,And I will write on the tables the words that were in the,,first tables which you broke.
27007,"And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in",,the ark which I had made.
27008,From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah,,unto Jotbath.
27009,Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD,,"is his inheritance, as the LORD thy God hath said unto him."
27010,"To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,",,which he hath commanded thee.
27011,"Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's",,"Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's: the earth also, with all that therein is."
27012,"Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose",,"their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
27013,Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your,,"heart, and be no more stiffnecked."
27014,"For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a",,"great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward."
27015,"He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow,",,"and he loveth the stranger, giving him food and raiment."
27016,Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye,,were strangers in the land of Egypt.
27017,"Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve,",,"and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name."
27018,"He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done",,for thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen.
27019,Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the,,LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
27020,"Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his",,"charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments alway."
27021,"And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of",,"the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years."
27022,And what he did unto you in the,,"past, you must forgive and let go."
27023,But your eyes have seen all the great,,wonders of the world.
27024,"But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land",,"of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven."
27025,And I will send grass in thy fields for,,thy cattle.
27026,"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and",,"that you turn not aside, and serve other gods, and worship them."
27027,And thou shalt write them upon the door,,posts of thine house.
27028,Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before,,"you, and you will take possession of their land."
27029,"Behold, I set before you this",,"day, a choice between blessing and curse."
27030,"A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the",,Lord your God.
27031,For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which,,the LORD your God giveth you.
27032,And ye shall observe to do all the statutes,,and judgments which I command you this day.
27033,"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served",,"their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree."
27034,Ye shall not do so,,"Ye shall not do so, for it is forbidden."
27035,Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here,,"this day, for every man does what is right in his own eyes."
27036,For ye are not as yet come to the rest and,,the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you.
27037,Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy,,sacrifice in every place that thou seest.
27038,Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye,,shall pour it upon the earth as water.
27039,Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the,,Lord thy God.
27040,"Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt",,eat them.
27041,Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is,,the life.
27042,Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt,,not desire it.
27043,"Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt",,keep.
27044,"When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither",,"thou goest to possess the land, thou shalt not covet their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works."
27045,"What thing soever I command you, observe to do it:",,"thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it."
27046,"If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer",,"of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,"
27047,"Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his",,"commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him."
27048,"Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine",,"eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him."
27049,But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him,,to put him to death.
27050,"And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do",,no more wickedness.
27051,"If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which",,"the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and"
27052,"Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it",,"be true, and the thing certain, then..."
27053,Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not,,"cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead."
27054,Thou shalt not eat,,Thou shalt not eat the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden.
27055,These are the beasts which ye shall eat:,,"the ox, the sheep, and the goat."
27056,"The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild",,"goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the bison."
27057,"And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two",,"and cheweth the cud among the beasts, shall ye eat."
27058,"And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is",,unclean.
27059,These ye shall eat of all that are in the,,waters.
27060,And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye,,shall not eat.
27061,Of all clean birds,,the dove is often seen as a symbol of peace.
27062,But these are they of which ye shall not,,"eat the flesh, nor touch their dead carcass."
27063,"And the glede, and the kite,",,"and the hawk of the wood,"
27064,"The little owl, and the",,"barn owl, both have distinctive heart-shaped faces."
27065,"And the pelican, and the",,"and the stork, and the heron, and the egret."
27066,"And the stork, and the heron after her",,"kind, and the lapwing, and the bat."
27067,And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean,,unto you.
27068,But of all clean,,"But of all clean options, water remains the most essential and widely used."
27069,Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy,,field year by year.
27070,"Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine",,hand.
27071,And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not,,oppress him.
27072,At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of,,"thy increase the same year, and lay it up within thy gates."
27073,At the end of every seven,,"years, the town holds a grand festival."
27074,Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that,,of thy brother thine hand shalt in any wise forbear.
27075,"Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God,",,"and do that which is right in his sight, and give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes,"
27076,"But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely",,"lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth."
27077,"And when thou sendest him out free from thee,",,thou shalt not let him go empty.
27078,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and",,the LORD thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
27079,"And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from",,"thee, then thou shalt say unto him, I will be thy servant."
27080,Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year,,in the place which the LORD shall choose.
27081,"And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or",,"have any ill favour therein, then shalt thou not offer it unto the LORD, nor make an offering of it by fire upon the altar."
27082,Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean,,shall eat it; as the roebuck and the hart.
27083,Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou,,shalt pour it upon the earth as water.
27084,"Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and",,the herd.
27085,Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of,,"thy gates, but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose."
27086,And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God,,shall choose.
27087,Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be,,a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God.
27088,Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks,,from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.
27089,And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in,,the land of Egypt.
27090,"Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after",,that thou hast gathered in thy threshing-floor and thy winepress.
27091,"Every man shall give as he is able, according to the",,blessing of the Lord your God.
27092,"Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy",,"God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment."
27093,"That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live,",,and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
27094,Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto,,the altar of the Lord thy God.
27095,Neither shalt thou set thee up any,,graven image.
27096,"Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is",,"blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God."
27097,"And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or",,"the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded."
27098,"And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired diligently, and,",,"behold, it is true, and the act is done indeed."
27099,"And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall",,"be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment."
27100,"And all the people shall hear, and",,"fear, and shall know that I am the Lord thy God."
27101,"Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not",,away from me.
27102,Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the,,Lord himself is their inheritance.
27103,"The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil,",,and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give unto the priest.
27104,"For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand",,"to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever."
27105,"Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as",,all the prophets did before him.
27106,"They shall have like portions to eat, beside that",,which cometh of the king's table.
27107,When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth,,"thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations."
27108,"Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar",,"spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer."
27109,For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because,,of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
27110,Thou shalt be perfect with,,thine own efforts and the grace of the divine.

27282,"Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus",,unto this land? What meaneth the heat of this anger?

27299,When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place,,"which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing."
27300,And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:,,"and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door."
27301,And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils,,"which they have committed, in turning to other gods."
27302,"Moses therefore wrote this song the same day,",,and taught it to the children of Israel.
27303,"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing",,"the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,"
27304,"That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the",,"ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,"
27305,"Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may",,speak these words in their hearing.
27306,And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of,,Israel the words which the LORD had spoken unto him.
27307,"Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;",,and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
27308,"My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as",,"the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass."
27309,Because I will publish the name of the,,"person who donated the most to our charity, everyone is eager to contribute."
27310,"He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are",,judgment.
27311,"They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot",,of the righteous.
27312,"Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he",,thy father that hath bought thee?
27313,"Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy",,"father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee."
27314,For the LORD's portion is his people;,,Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
27315,"He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led",,"him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye."
27316,"As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,",,"so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him."
27317,"So the LORD alone did lead him, and",,there was no strange god with him.
27318,"They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods,",,and they vexed him with abominations.
27319,"They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not,",,to new gods who came lately among them.
27320,Of the Rock that begat thee thou art,,ashamed.
27321,"And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because",,of the wickedness of their doings.
27322,I will heap mischiefs upon them; I,,will not spare my wrath.
27323,"The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man",,"and the virgin, the nursing child and the man of gray hairs."
27324,"I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would",,make them run and hide.
27325,"For they are a nation void of counsel,",,neither is there any understanding in them.
27326,"O that they were wise, that they understood",,"this, that they would consider their latter end!"
27327,"How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,",,"according to the saying, by being so formidable that the mere sight or rumor of your approach causes them to flee in terror."
27328,For their rock is not as our,,"rock, for their rock is as shifting sand."
27329,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields",,of Gomorrah.
27330,"Their wine is the poison of dragons,",,"the tears of saints, and the blood of kings."
27331,Is not this laid up in store with,,thee?
27332,"For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he",,"seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left."
27333,"And he shall say, Where are their",,gods?
27334,"Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their",,libations.
27335,For I lift up my hand to,,"heaven and swear,"
27336,"If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I",,will execute judgment upon mine enemies.
27337,And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in,,the ears of the people.
27338,And Moses made an end of speaking,,all that the Lord had commanded him to speak.
27339,"And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people;",,as Aaron thy brother died.
27340,Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not,,go over thither.
27341,"And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of",,God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
27342,"Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and",,they sit down in great peace; and they inherit the land.
27343,"Moses commanded us a law, even the",,Ten Commandments.
27344,"And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of",,the people and the tribes of Israel gathered together.
27345,"Let Reuben live, and not die; and",,let his life be spared.
27346,"They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall",,"put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar."
27347,"And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the",,"precious things of heaven, with the dew, and the deep that coucheth beneath, and the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and the"
27348,"And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,",,we give thanks and celebrate their bounty.
27349,"And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,",,they are the everlasting hills.
27350,"And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in",,"thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents."
27351,"And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth",,"as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head."
27352,"And of Dan he said, Dan is a",,lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.
27353,"And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with",,the blessings of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.
27354,"And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him",,"be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil."
27355,Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and,,"as thy days, so shall thy strength be."
27356,"There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon",,"the heaven in thy help, and with his excellency on the sky."
27357,"The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he",,"shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them."
27358,Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon,,a land of corn and wine; his heavens shall also drop dew.
27359,"And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh,",,"and all the land of Issachar, and all the land of Asher, and all the land of Zebulun, and the coast"
27360,"And the south, and the plain of the valley",,"of the Jordan, and the slopes of the mountains."
27361,So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the,,"land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD."
27362,"And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over",,against the city of Beth-peor.
27363,And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he,,died.
27364,And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab,,thirty days.
27365,And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like,,"Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face."
27366,"And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great",,"power thereof, which Moses showed before the children of Israel."
27367,Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to,,"pass over the Jordan, they rose early in the morning, and went from Shittim, and came to Jordan, they, and all the men"
27368,"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon,",,"that have I given unto thee, as I said unto Abraham thy father."
27369,Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide,,"for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them."
27370,"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid,",,neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
27371,Then Joshua commanded the officers,,"to pass through the host, and to command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan"
27372,"And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and",,"to the half tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,"
27373,"Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The",,"LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land."
27374,"And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we",,"will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go."
27375,"According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto",,thee.
27376,"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in",,to the city to search out the land.
27377,"And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,",,"""I know not whither they are gone."""
27378,"But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them",,in the rafters.
27379,And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as,,"soon as those who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate."
27380,"And before they were laid down, she",,made sure they were perfectly aligned.
27381,"And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren,",,and bring them down to Egypt.
27382,Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her,,house was on the city wall.
27383,"And the men said unto her, We will be blameless",,of this matter.
27384,"And if thou utter this our business, then we will be",,in great danger.
27385,"And she said, According unto",,thy words.
27386,"So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came",,"to the other side of the river, and went their way."
27387,"And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the",,land.
27388,"And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to",,"Jordan, they, and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over."
27389,"And it came to pass after three days,",,"that they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions."
27390,"And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for",,tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
27391,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither,",,and worship the Lord your God.
27392,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of",,all the earth.
27393,Now therefore take you twelve men out of the,,"tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe."
27394,"And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass",,"over the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan were cut off from flowing."
27395,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean",,"passed over Jordan, that the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the place which Joshua had prepared for it."
27396,Take you twelve men out of the,,Twelve men out of the crowd.
27397,"Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of",,"the children of Israel, one of every tribe:"
27398,"That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask",,"in time to come, 'What do these stones mean to you?'"
27399,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the",,"ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of all the people."
27400,"And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of",,"Manasseh, built an altar on the east side of Jordan."
27401,About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before,,"the presence of the Lord unto battle, in the plains of Moab, over against Jericho."
27402,On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and,,"they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life."
27403,Command the priests that bear the ark of the,,Lord to stand still in the midst of Jordan.
27404,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying,",,"""Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people."""
27405,And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of,,"the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho."
27406,"And those twelve stones, which they took out",,"of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal."
27407,"And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall",,"say to you, What mean these stones?"
27408,"Then ye shall let your children know, saying,",,"This is what the LORD did to bring us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
27409,"That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD,",,that it is mighty.
27410,"At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp",,knives.
27411,"And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the",,children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
27412,"And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised:",,"for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the way."
27413,"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people,",,that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole.
27414,"And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on",,the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
27415,And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the,,morrow after the passover.
27416,"And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe",,from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.
27417,Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children,,"of Israel: none went out, and none came in."
27418,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine",,"hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor."
27419,"And ye shall compass the city, all ye men",,"of war, and go round about the city once."
27420,"And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and",,let not a man look back.
27421,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the",,"rearward came after the ark, and the priests went on blowing with the trumpets."
27422,"So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it",,once.
27423,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the",,priests took up the ark of the LORD.
27424,"And the second day they compassed the city once, and",,returned unto the camp.
27425,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the",,"trumpets, that the people shouted and said, ""The Lord has given us the land!"""
27426,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are",,to be dedicated to the Lord.
27427,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young",,"and old, ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword."
27428,So the LORD was with Joshua; and his,,fame was noised throughout all the country.
27429,So there went up thither of the people about three,,thousand men.
27430,"O LORD, what shall I say, when",,Israel turneth away from thy presence?
27431,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee",,"up, wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?"
27432,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel",,"out of Shittim, and they came to the Jordan, and lodged there before they passed over."
27433,And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites:,,and he brought them by their genealogies.
27434,"And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the",,"son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
27435,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the",,LORD God of Israel.
27436,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold,",,it was rolled together in her hand.
27437,"And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto",,the place of execution.
27438,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and",,"Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night."
27439,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even",,behind it.
27440,"Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the",,city.
27441,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and",,went over before them to Jericho.
27442,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in",,ambush in the valley.
27443,And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten,,"before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
27444,And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after,,Israel.
27445,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not",,out against Israel.
27446,And the king of Ai they took,,alive.
27447,"And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of",,"light and darkness, were entwined in an eternal dance."
27448,"For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the",,spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
27449,Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey,,"unto themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua."
27450,"And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap",,"for ever; even a desolate waste, as it is unto this day."
27451,Then Joshua built an altar unto the,,Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal.
27452,And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of,,"Moses, which the LORD had spoken to them on the mountain."
27453,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and",,"the curses, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
27454,"That they gathered themselves together, to fight with",,Moses and Aaron.
27455,And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what,,"Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, they worked craftily."
27456,"They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and",,spoke with great eloquence and diplomacy.
27457,"And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon",,their backs.
27458,"And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell",,among us; therefore we cannot give our daughters unto you.
27459,"And they said unto Joshua,",,"""Truly the LORD our God is with you in all that you do."""
27460,"And the men took of their victuals, and asked",,not whether it was clean or unclean.
27461,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to",,let them live.
27462,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came",,unto the wilderness of Sinai.
27463,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them",,"by the LORD God of Israel, and now therefore we may not touch them."
27464,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest",,we be like them.
27465,"And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of",,wood and drawers of water for all the congregation; as the princes had spoken to them.
27466,"And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye",,deceived us?
27467,"Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being",,bondmen forever.
27468,"And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth",,"good in thine eyes to do unto us, do."
27469,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the",,hand of their enemies.
27470,"That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal",,"cities, and because all the men thereof were mighty."
27471,"Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king",,"of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, Come up"
27472,"Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for",,it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
27473,"So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of",,"war with him, and all the mighty men of valor."
27474,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them",,into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
27475,"Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and",,"Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and smote them with the edge of the sword."
27476,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the",,Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man.
27477,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with",,"him, to the camp at Gilgal."
27478,"But these five kings fled, and hid",,in the cave at Makkedah.
27479,"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings",,are fled into a cave at Makkedah.
27480,"And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the",,"cave, and set men by it for to keep them."
27481,And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in,,peace.
27482,"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring",,out those five kings unto me.
27483,"And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good",,courage.
27484,"And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on",,five trees.
27485,"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel",,"with him, to Libnah, and they fought against Libnah."
27486,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him,",,"unto Lachish, and they fought against it."
27487,Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua,,smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining.
27488,"And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with",,him.
27489,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel",,"with him, to fight against Debir."
27490,"And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza,",,and from all the country of Goshen even unto Gibeon.
27491,And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at,,one time.
27492,"And when all these kings were met together, they came and",,they came and pitched in the valley of Siddim.
27493,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against",,Amalek to the battle at Rephidim.
27494,And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him:,,"he smote them, and slew them with a great slaughter, and hanged them on five trees, and they hung on the trees until the evening"
27495,"And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king",,thereof with the sword.
27496,"But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel",,did not drive them out.
27497,"As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so",,did Joshua do.
27498,Joshua made war a long,,Joshua made war a long time ago.
27499,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel,",,"except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon."
27500,There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children,,of Israel: they were all destroyed.
27501,"And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the",,"remnant of the giants, he had only one bedstead of iron."
27502,"The king of Jericho, one; the king",,"of Ai, two; the king of Jerusalem, three; the king of Hebron, four; the king of Jarmuth, five; the"
27503,"The king of Jerusalem, one;",,"the queen of Sheba, two."
27504,"The king of Jarmuth, one;",,"the king of Eglon, one;"
27505,"The king of Eglon, one;",,"the king of Makkedah, two;"
27506,"The king of Debir, one;",,"the king of Eglon, one;"
27507,"The king of Hormah, one;",,"the king of Arad, another."
27508,"The king of Libnah, one;",,"the king of Adullam, one;"
27509,"The king of Makkedah, one;",,"the king of Bethel, two;"
27510,"The king of Tappuah, one;",,"the king of Hepher, one;"

27512,"The king of Madon, one;",,"the queen of Madon, two."
27513,"The king of Shimronmeron, one;",,"the king of Achshaph, two;"
27514,"The king of Taanach, one;",,"the king of Megiddo, one;"
27515,"The king of Kedesh, one; the",,"king of Ai, one; the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; the king of Jarmuth, one;"
27516,"The king of Dor in the coast of Dor,",,was known for his wise and just rule.
27517,"The king of Tirzah, one: all",,"The king of Tirzah, one: all hail the ruler of the ancient city."
27518,This is the land that yet remaineth: all,,"the untamed wilderness, vast and uncharted, where the brave may still discover and the bold may still dream."
27519,"From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that",,"is on the border of the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites."
27520,"And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the",,"rising of the sun, from Baal-gad under Mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath."
27521,Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto,,the two tribes and the half tribe.
27522,"With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave",,"them on the other side of Jordan, toward the sunrise."
27523,"From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that",,"is in the midst of the river, and all the plains of Medeba."
27524,"And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which",,"he had conquered from the king of Moab, were given to the children of Israel."
27525,"And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,",,"and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah."
27526,"Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but",,the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites unto this day.
27527,Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD,,"God of Israel were their inheritance, as he said unto them."
27528,And Moses gave unto the tribe of the,,"children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the kingdom of"
27529,"Heshbon, and all her cities that are in",,the plain.
27530,"And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar",,in the valley of Beth-peor.
27531,"Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of",,Israel defeat by cursing their enemies.
27532,"And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even",,the children of Gad according to their families.
27533,"And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half",,the cities of Ammon.
27534,"And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and",,from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim.
27535,This is the inheritance of the children of Gad,,according to their families.
27536,And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the,,possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
27537,"And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king",,"of Bashan, and all the cities of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities."
27538,These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the,,land of Canaan.
27539,But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the,,"Lord God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them."
27540,"By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand",,of Moses.
27541,For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on,,the other side of Jordan.
27542,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children",,of Israel did.
27543,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of,,the people melt.
27544,"And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb",,the land of Hebron for an inheritance.
27545,Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite,,to this day.
27546,And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which,,was the greatest city in the land of Canaan at that time.
27547,And their south border was from the shore of,,"the Dead Sea, eastward to the ascent of Akrabbim."
27548,"And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah;",,and went down to the Stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
27549,And the west border was to the,,Mediterranean Sea.
27550,"And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak,",,"Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai."
27551,And he went up thence to the inhabitants of,,Bethel.
27552,"And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,",,to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
27553,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took",,it.
27554,This is the inheritance of the tribe of,,"Reuben, as the LORD commanded through Moses."
27555,And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah,,"toward the coast of Edom southward were Ziklag, and Kinah, and Hazor, and Ithnan, and Ziph"

27808,Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east,,"gathered themselves together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel."
27809,"But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and",,"he blew the trumpet, and Abiezer was gathered together after him."
27810,"And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save",,"Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the"
27811,"And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the",,"flock together, and drove them over the water."
27812,And God did so that night: for it was dry upon,,"Pharaoh's chariots and upon all the chariots of Egypt, so that they went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground"
27813,"And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise,",,"go down unto the winepress, for I will cause it to rain."
27814,"But if thou fear to go down, go thou",,with me.
27815,"And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a",,"trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps inside the pitchers."
27816,And they stood every man in his place round about the,,ark of the Lord.
27817,"And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out",,"of Asher, and out of Zebulun, with their hosts."
27818,"And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is",,not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?
27819,"And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the",,"three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing."
27820,"And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna",,"now in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?"
27821,"And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand,",,then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
27822,"And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the",,men of Penuel answered him as the men of Shechem had done.
27823,"And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When",,"I return in peace, then shall I break down this tower."
27824,And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the,,east of Nobah and Jogbehah.
27825,"And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the",,"kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, alive."
27826,And Gideon the son of Joash returned,,from the battle in the heat of the day.
27827,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the",,"wilderness, and with them he taught them a lesson."
27828,"And he beat down the tower of Penuel,",,and slew all the men thereof.
27829,"And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as",,"the LORD liveth, if I had not been afraid, I would surely have slain you."
27830,And he said unto Jether his,,"firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth did not draw his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth."
27831,"And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither",,shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
27832,"And they answered, We",,will go.
27833,And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went,,and dwelt in his own house.
27834,And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of,,his own begotten.
27835,"And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also",,fled from him.
27836,"And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was",,buried in the sepulchre of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
27837,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of",,"Israel turned again, and went a whoring after the Baals, and made Baalberith their god."
27838,"And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had",,delivered them out of the hands of their enemies.
27839,"Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon,",,nor did they show kindness to his seventy sons.
27840,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed",,"with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,"
27841,And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the,,house of the LORD.
27842,"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and",,went to the pillar that was in Shechem.
27843,The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over,,them.
27844,"But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by",,"me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
27845,And the trees said to the fig,,"""Shade us with your leaves."""
27846,"But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,",,"and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
27847,"Then said the trees unto the vine,",,"""Reign thou over us."""
27848,"And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which",,"cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
27849,Then said all the trees unto the,,"bramble, Reign thou over us."
27850,"(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life",,for your sake.)
27851,If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house,,"this day; then rejoice ye, and let Jerubbaal rejoice over you."
27852,"And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer,",,and he dwelt there for fear of his brother Abimelech.
27853,When Abimelech had reigned,,"over Israel three years,"
27854,Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men,,of Shechem.
27855,"And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over",,to Shechem.
27856,And would to God this people were under,,His care and protection always.
27857,And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words,,"of Abimelech, his anger was kindled."
27858,"And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and",,"his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they incite the city against thee."
27859,"Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that",,"are with thee, and get you away."
27860,"And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him,",,and they went up by the way of the plain to Kadesh.
27861,"And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the middle",,of the plain.
27862,And Gaal went out before the men,,of Shechem to meet them.
27863,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many",,fell.
27864,And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal,,and his brethren.
27865,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the",,people gathered together early in the morning.
27866,"And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that,",,they went into the house of the god Berith.
27867,"And it was told Abimelech, that all the men",,of the field were gathered together against him.
27868,"Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and",,"encamped against Thebez, and took it."
27869,"And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went",,up to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
27870,And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone,,"upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull."
27871,And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech,,"was dead, they went every man to his place."
27872,"Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he",,"had done to his father, by slaying his seventy brethren."
27873,And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their,,heads.
27874,"And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son",,"of Dodo, a man of Issachar."
27875,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years,",,"and he died, and was buried in his city."
27876,"And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite,",,and he judged Israel for twenty-two years.
27877,"And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty",,cities.
27878,"And Jair died, and",,was buried in Camon.
27879,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into",,the hand of the Philistines.
27880,"Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and",,against Israel.
27881,"And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned",,"against thee, we will do no more so; deliver us, we pray thee, from the hand of the Philistines."
27882,"And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from",,the Egyptians?
27883,"The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and",,"you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand."
27884,"Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other",,gods.
27885,Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen;,,let them save you in the time of your trouble.
27886,"And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto",,us according to all that thou hast said.
27887,"And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served",,the Lord.
27888,Then the children of Ammon were,,defeated.
27889,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and",,he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
27890,"Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob:",,"and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and they went out with him."
27891,"And it came to pass in process of time,",,that the Lord looked upon Abel and his offering.
27892,"And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,",,"Jephthah the Gileadite, a mighty man of valor, was summoned to lead the fight."
27893,"And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain,",,that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
27894,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness",,between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.
27895,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and",,leader over them.
27896,And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the,,"Ammonites, saying,"
27897,"And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the",,"land of Moab, neither the land of the Ammonites."
27898,"But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through",,"the wilderness, they came to Sinai."
27899,But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered,,"all his people together, and pitched against Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
27900,"And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon",,"to Jabbok, and the Jordan."
27901,So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites,,from before his people Israel.
27902,Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever,,"the LORD our God hath driven out from before us, we will possess it."
27903,"And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of",,Moab?
27904,Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not,,unto the messengers of Jephthah.
27905,"And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou",,"shalt surely deliver the children of Ammon into my hands, then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet"
27906,So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight,,against them.
27907,And he,,walked away.
27908,That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the,,daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
27909,And Jephthah judged,,Israel six years.
27910,And after him Ibzan,,judged Israel.
27911,"And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent",,"abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons."
27912,"Then died Ibzan, and",,was buried in Bethlehem.
27913,"And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged",,Israel for ten years.
27914,"And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried",,in the city of his fathers.
27915,And after him Abdon the son,,of Hillel the Pirathonite.
27916,"And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on",,sixty young donkeys.
27917,"And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in",,Pirathon.
27918,And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD;,,and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
27919,"And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the",,"Danites, whose name was Manoah."
27920,"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold",,"now thou art barren, but thou shalt bear a son."
27921,"Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine",,nor strong drink.
27922,"And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said unto him,",,"Arise, for the man hath come who told me all these things."
27923,"And Manoah said, Now let",,us arise and follow them.
27924,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of",,"all that I have said unto the woman, let her beware."
27925,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let",,us see thee no more.
27926,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,",,that we may do thee honor when thy saying comes to pass?
27927,"And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why",,"askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?"
27928,"So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock",,unto the LORD.
27929,But the angel of the LORD did no,,more wonders among them.
27930,"And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall",,"surely die, for we have seen God."
27931,"And the woman bare a son, and called his name",,Seth.
27932,And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at,,"at times in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol."
27933,"And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a",,woman.
27934,"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came",,to the vineyards of Timnath.
27935,"And he went down, and talked with",,the man.
27936,So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made,,there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
27937,"And it came to pass, when they saw him,",,they were amazed.
27938,"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came",,"forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness."
27939,"But Samson's wife was given to his companion,",,whom he had chosen as a friend.
27940,"And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more",,vengeant than ever.
27941,"And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned",,"tail to tail, and put a firebrand between every two tails."
27942,"And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will",,I not cease my rage until I have paid you back in full.
27943,And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and,,he went down peaceably to his house.
27944,"Then the Philistines went up, and pitched",,"in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi."
27945,"And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth",,"his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith."
27946,"And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,",,"with the jawbone of an ass, have I slain a thousand men."
27947,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that",,he sat down.
27948,And he judged Israel in the,,days of the Philistines.
27949,"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there",,"an harlot, and went in unto her."
27950,"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a",,"woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah."
27951,"And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy",,great strength lieth.
27952,"And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that",,"were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
27953,Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green,,cords with which they had bound Samson.
27954,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me",,"lies; now tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth."
27955,"And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that",,"never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
27956,"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her",,"words, that he was sore troubled; for he said unto her, I have never told it to any man or woman."
27957,Howbeit the hair of his head began,,to grow again.
27958,"And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that",,"I may feel the pillars of the house, that I may lean upon them."
27959,And there was a man of,,"the people, and his name was Boaz."
27960,"And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod,",,"and two teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons to be his priest."
27961,"In those days there was no king in Israel, but every",,man did what was right in his own eyes.
27962,And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the,,"family of Judah, and his name was Boaz."
27963,"And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am",,a prophet from Judah.
27964,And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and,,the man made him as one of his household.
27965,And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became,,"his priest, and was in the house of Micah."
27966,"Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do",,good to me; for the LORD hath spoken good concerning me.
27967,"And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with",,me.
27968,"And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that",,we may know whether the journey shall prosper.
27969,"And the priest said unto them, Go in peace:",,your sins are forgiven.
27970,And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol:,,and all the house of Israel with them.
27971,"And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of",,"Zorah and Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war."
27972,"And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they",,called the name of that place Mahanaim.
27973,"And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim,",,and there they found the man's house where the concubine had been.
27974,"And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young",,"man, the Levite, and saluted him."
27975,"And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were",,"in the hand of every man, and they turned back again to the city."
27976,"And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved",,"image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image."
27977,"And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the",,"Urim and Thummim, and he inquired of the Lord."
27978,"So they turned and departed, and put the little",,one in a safe place.
27979,And they cried unto,,the Lord.
27980,And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they,,"were too strong for him, he turned and went back into his house."
27981,"And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made,",,all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
27982,"And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him",,to her father's house.
27983,"And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode",,"with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there."
27984,"And when the man rose up to depart, his father",,gave him a kiss and embraced him warmly.
27985,"And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to",,this city.
27986,And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went,,"down, and the stars came out."
27987,"And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all",,thy ways be ordered by wisdom and grace.
27988,"So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the",,"ass, and water to wash his feet, and he set meat before him."
27989,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at",,"his feet, crying for mercy."
27990,(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the,,children of Israel were going up to the house of God at Mizpah.)
27991,"And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said,",,"""Thus and thus dealt my concubine with me, and she put me away from me."""
27992,"Behold, ye are all children of Israel;",,"and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
27993,"And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us",,go home until the matter is resolved.
27994,But now this shall be the thing which we will do,,to those who have acted against us.
27995,So all the men of Israel were gathered,,together.
27996,And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of,,"Benjamin, saying, ""What wickedness is this that has happened among you?"""
27997,But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities,,"unto their brethren in Gibeah, and went out to battle against the children of Israel."
27998,Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every,,one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
27999,"And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred",,thousand.
28000,And the children of Israel rose up,,and went up to the house of God.
28001,And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the,,men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
28002,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down",,"to the ground, both the city and the souls that were therein."
28003,"And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again",,in array.
28004,And the children of Israel came near against,,the Philistines.
28005,"And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the",,"ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,)"
28006,And Israel set liers in,,Achor.
28007,And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the,,third day.
28008,"And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and",,"the battle was sore, for it was a fierce fight."
28009,"And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait",,"made a great slaughter; for it was a sore battle, and there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men."
28010,"And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin",,"were discomfited, for they saw that evil was come upon them."
28011,"Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and",,trod them down with ease.
28012,And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand,,and there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand
28013,So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five,,thousand.
28014,But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto,,the hill of God.
28015,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall",,not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
28016,"And the people came to the house of God, and abode there",,till the evening.
28017,"And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass",,in Israel?
28018,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,",,"and went up to the top of the mountain, as Moses had said."
28019,"And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and",,"said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day."
28020,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn",,that we would not give them our daughters?
28021,"For the people were numbered, and, behold, there",,were none of them left.
28022,"And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly",,destroy them.
28023,And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin,,"saying, ""What wickedness is this that has happened among you?"""
28024,And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had,,saved alive out of the women of Jabesh-gilead.
28025,"And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the",,LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
28026,"Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives",,for our young men?
28027,"And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be",,"of the tribe, that they may possess it."
28028,Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of,,"Israel are a holy seed, and must not be mingled with the people of the land."
28029,"Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying,",,Go and lie in wait in the vineyards.
28030,"And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe",,and to his family.
28031,In those days there was no king in Israel: every,,man did that which was right in his own eyes.
28032,And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she,,was left with her two sons.
28033,And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the,,woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
28034,"The LORD grant you that ye may find rest,",,each one in the house of his wife.
28035,"And they said unto her, Surely we",,will do this thing that thou hast said unto us.
28036,"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are",,"there yet any sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
28037,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah",,kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her.
28038,"And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her",,"people; therefore go thou thy way, return unto thy mother's house."
28039,"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do",,"so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."
28040,When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to,,"refuse his offer, he sighed and turned away."
28041,"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me",,Mara.
28042,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of",,"wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz."
28043,"And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said",,"unto the reapers, The LORD be with you."
28044,Then said Boaz unto his servant that was,,"set over the reapers, Gather therefore now the sheaf, and beat out the corn, and leave the handfuls for her to glean."
28045,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is",,"a man of the house of Judah, an Hebrew, one of our brethren."
28046,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean",,"in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens."
28047,"The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of",,"the LORD God of Israel, to whom thou hast showed kindness."
28048,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,",,"saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not."
28049,"And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her,",,that she may glean and sustain herself.
28050,"So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that",,which she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
28051,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep",,fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest.
28052,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that",,"thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field."
28053,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end,,of the barley and wheat harvest.
28054,"Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I",,"not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?"
28055,"And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens",,she was?
28056,"And she said unto her, All that",,thou sayest I will do.
28057,"And she went down unto the floor, and did according",,as she was commanded.
28058,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid,",,"and he arose and went out of the house, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and he fell down in fear."
28059,"And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid:",,"spray me, I pray thee, with thy skirt."
28060,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest:",,for I know that thou art a virtuous woman.
28061,And now it is true that I am thy near,,neighbor.
28062,"And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou,",,my daughter?
28063,"And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for",,"he said unto me, Go not to Beth-lehem."
28064,And he took ten men of the elders of,,"the city, and said, Sit ye down here."
28065,"And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the",,"country of Moab, hath a field to sell, and thou hast right of redemption to buy it."
28066,"And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine",,own inheritance.
28067,Therefore the kinsman said unto,,"Boaz, ""Buy it for thyself."""
28068,"And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto",,Judah.
28069,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went",,"in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son."
28070,"And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left",,thee without a kinsman.
28071,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it",,in her bosom.
28072,"And Hezron begat Ram,",,and Ram begat Amminadab.
28073,"And Amminadab begat Nahshon,",,"and Nahshon begat Salmon,"
28074,"And Salmon begat Boaz,",,"and Boaz begat Obed,"
28075,"And Obed begat Jesse,",,and Jesse begat David.
28076,"And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the",,the name of the other was Peninnah.
28077,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah",,"his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, their portions."
28078,But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he,,loved her.
28079,"And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make",,her fret.
28080,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house",,"to bring him his dinner, she would always leave a small bouquet of wildflowers on the windowsill."
28081,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and",,wept sore.
28082,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying",,that her heart was filled with a profound sense of peace and hope.
28083,"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but",,her voice was not heard.
28084,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou",,be drunken?
28085,Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of,,the abundance of her heart her mouth speaketh.
28086,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of",,Israel be with thee.
28087,"And she said, Let thine handmaid",,fall at thy feet.
28088,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to",,offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow.
28089,"And they slew a bullock, and",,offered it as a sacrifice.
28090,"And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I",,will do as thou hast said.
28091,For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath,,given me my request which I asked of him.
28092,Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long,,"as he lives, he is lent to the LORD."
28093,There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none,,besides thee.
28094,Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth:,,for wickedness shall not have success.
28095,"The bows of the mighty men are broken,",,and the weak have girded themselves with strength.
28096,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth",,"down to the grave, and bringeth up."
28097,"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich:",,"he bringeth low, and lifteth up."
28098,"He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall",,be silent in darkness.
28099,And Elkanah went to,,Ramah to his house.
28100,Now the sons of Eli were sons,,of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
28101,Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before,,the LORD.
28102,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being",,a child.
28103,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year",,to year.
28104,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she",,conceived and bore a son.
28105,"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for",,"the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and findeth none."
28106,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that",,I hear of you.
28107,"And the child Samuel grew on, and was in",,favor with the Lord and also with men.
28108,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of",,"thy seed after thee, that there shall not be an old man in thy house."
28109,"And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two",,"sons, Phinehas and Ithamar."
28110,And the child Samuel ministered,,unto the Lord before Eli.
28111,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in",,"his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;"
28112,"And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,",,"Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only"
28113,That the LORD called Samuel: and,,"he answered, Here am I."
28114,"And he ran unto Eli, and said,",,"""Here am I; for thou calledst me."""
28115,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was",,the word of the LORD revealed unto him.
28116,"And the LORD came, and stood, and",,"called as he had called the first time, Samuel, Samuel."
28117,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,",,at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
28118,In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have,,"spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end."
28119,For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the,,iniquity which he knoweth.
28120,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity",,of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
28121,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened",,the doors of the house of the LORD.
28122,"Then Eli called Samuel, and",,"Samuel answered, ""Here I am."""
28123,"And Samuel told him every whit,",,and hid nothing from him.
28124,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and",,did let none of his words fall to the ground.
28125,And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that,,Samuel was appointed as judge over Israel.
28126,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed,,himself in Shiloh.
28127,And the word of Samuel,,came to all Israel.
28128,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,",,"all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again."
28129,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they",,saw that their gods were powerless.
28130,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods?,,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? Only the most valiant and wise among us can hope to
28131,"Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants",,to the Hebrews.
28132,And the ark of God was taken; and the,,"two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
28133,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to",,"Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head."
28134,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the",,noise of this weeping?
28135,Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and,,"his eyes were dim, so that he could not see."
28136,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the",,ark of God was taken.
28137,"And she said, The glory is departed from",,Israel.
28138,"And the Philistines took the ark of God,",,and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
28139,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it",,"into the house of Dagon, their god."
28140,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's",,"house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day."
28141,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he",,"destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof."
28142,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods:,,and they had emerods in their secret parts.
28143,And the ark of the LORD was in,,the country of the Philistines seven months.
28144,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied",,"them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home."
28145,"And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the",,"and they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the oxen drew it."
28146,And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they,,"lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it."
28147,And when the five lords of the Philistines had,,"seen the ark of the Lord, they sent it back to its place."
28148,"And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this",,holy Lord God?
28149,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again",,"the ark of the Lord; come ye down, and fetch it up."
28150,Then the children of Israel did put away,,"the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD."
28151,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and",,I will pray for you to the LORD.
28152,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto",,the LORD.
28153,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued",,"the Philistines, and smote them."
28154,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and",,"called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us."
28155,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel:",,and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
28156,And Samuel judged Israel all,,the days of his life.
28157,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel,",,"and to Gilgal, and to Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places."
28158,And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there,,"he returned, and there he died."
28159,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old,",,that he made his sons judges over Israel.
28160,Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the,,name of his second was Abijah.
28161,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned",,to their own devices.
28162,Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves,,together and came to Samuel unto Ramah.
28163,"And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in",,thy ways; now make a king to reign over us like all the nations.
28164,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said,",,"""Give us a king to judge us."""
28165,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and",,shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
28166,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD,,to the people.
28167,"And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries,",,and your sons to be warriors.
28168,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards,",,and give them to his servants.
28169,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of",,"your vineyards, and give it to his officers, and to his servants."
28170,"And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest",,"young men, and your asses, and put them to his work."
28171,He will take the tenth of your,,income.
28172,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye,,shall have chosen.
28173,Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and,,"they said, ""No, but there shall be a king over us."""
28174,That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king,,"may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
28175,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and",,he repeated them to the Lord.
28176,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto",,"the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not"
28177,And the asses of Kish,,were fat and well-fed.
28178,"Then said Saul to his servant,",,"""Surely they will hear that the king of Israel is come out to seek my life; and therefore have I come forth to meet them."""
28179,"And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens",,coming out to meet them with garlands and songs.
28180,"And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city,",,they went to the upper room where they were staying.
28181,Now the LORD had told Samuel in his,,earlier days that he would raise up a faithful priest.
28182,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man",,whom I spake to thee of.
28183,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said,",,"""Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is."""
28184,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave",,"thee, that which I said unto thee, Behold, it is before thee."
28185,And when they were come down from the high place into the,,"city, the same disciples that were with him in Galilee followed him."
28186,"And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves",,of bread.
28187,"And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou",,"shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man."
28188,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that",,thou shalt do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.
28189,"And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel,",,"God was with him, and he became king over Israel."
28190,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met",,"him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
28191,"And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their",,king?
28192,And when he had made an end of,,"speaking, he sat down."
28193,"And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I",,"pray thee, what the young man has said."
28194,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told",,us nothing but that we found the asses.
28195,And Samuel called the people together,,"and said, ""The Lord is witness."""
28196,And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel,,"to come near, he took a vial of oil and poured it on Saul's head and kissed him, saying, ""Has not the Lord an"
28197,"Therefore they inquired of the LORD further,",,"saying, ""Shall we go up against our enemies or shall we turn back?"""
28198,"And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people,",,they looked upon him with wonder and amazement.
28199,And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with,,"him a company of men, whose hearts God had touched."
28200,"But the children of Belial said, How shall this man",,save us?
28201,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of",,"Jabeshgilead said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee."
28202,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the",,ears of the people.
28203,And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he,,"saw the company of prophets, and he prophesied among them."
28204,"And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel",,were three hundred thousand.
28205,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto",,you and do as you say.
28206,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul",,reign over us?
28207,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death",,this day; for today the LORD has wrought salvation in Israel.
28208,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let",,"us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
28209,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in",,"all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you."
28210,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed",,"us, nor dealt falsely with us."
28211,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and",,"Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt."
28212,"Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all",,the good and the bad that has come to pass.
28213,"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you",,"out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe."
28214,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye",,"have desired; and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you."
28215,"Now therefore stand and see this great thing,",,which the Lord will do before your eyes.
28216,So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain,,that day.
28217,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet",,"turn again to the LORD your God, and he will save you."
28218,And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after,,vain things which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
28219,For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's,,sake.
28220,"Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing",,to pray for you.
28221,"Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your",,heart.
28222,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye",,shall surely be consumed.
28223,Saul reigned one year; and when he,,"had reigned two years over Israel,"
28224,And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan,,to the land of Gilead.
28225,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed:",,and Saul and his men waited.
28226,"And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt",,offering and peace offerings.
28227,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up",,"from Ramah, and went and came to Naioth in Ramah."
28228,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with",,"them, went over to the Philistines."
28229,And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one,,"company by the way that leadeth to Ophrah, towards Shual; another company turned the way to Bethhoron; and the third company"
28230,And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the,,way that leadeth to Azekah.
28231,Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:,,"for the Philistines said, ""Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears."""
28232,"But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every",,"man’s plowshare, mattock, ax, and sickle."
28233,"Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and",,"for the forks, and for all manner of tools."
28234,And the garrison of the Philistines went,,out to the pass of Michmash.
28235,And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is,,in Migron.
28236,The forefront of the one was situate northward over,,"the other, casting a long shadow as the sun set in the west."
28237,"And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine",,heart; I am with thee.
28238,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto",,"the Philistines' garrison, and it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save"
28239,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we",,will wait for them to arrive.
28240,And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines,,"said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."
28241,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer",,went behind him.
28242,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within",,half a furrow's length in an acre of land.
28243,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold,",,the multitude was going up by degrees.
28244,"And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring",,the ark of God.
28245,"Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they",,"heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle."
28246,So the LORD saved Israel that day:,,and the battle was turned unto Helon.
28247,And all they of the land came to a,,great feast.
28248,"And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but",,"no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath."
28249,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how",,"my father's countenance is changed toward me, for ye are afraid to tell me."
28250,And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash,,to Aijalon.
28251,"And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and",,slew them on the ground.
28252,And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same,,was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
28253,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou",,deliver them into the hand of Israel?
28254,"And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the",,"people, and hear ye this: I will speak in the ears of all the people."
28255,Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God,,"of Israel, Keep not thou silence to me: for they have given a present unto me to day, and I have not eaten of it until this"
28256,"And Saul said, Cast lots between",,me and my son Jonathan.
28257,"And Saul answered, God do so and more",,"also, to me, if I do this thing."
28258,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines:,,"and when he looked around, behold, no one was with him but his son Jonathan."
28259,"And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered",,Israel out of their hands.
28260,"And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name",,of Saul's son was Jonathan.
28261,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner,,was the father of Abner.
28262,And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when,,"when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to be one of his chief captains."
28263,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how",,he set himself against him in the way when he came up from Egypt.
28264,"And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim,",,"two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
28265,And Saul came to a city of,,"Samaria, and behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
28266,And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou,,"comest to Shur, which is before Egypt."
28267,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and",,all his people he utterly destroyed with the edge of the sword.
28268,Then came the word of,,the Lord.
28269,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be",,thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
28270,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in",,"mine ears, and the lowing of the kine which I hear?"
28271,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell",,thee what the Lord hath said unto me this night.
28272,"And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made",,the head of the tribes of Israel?
28273,"And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly",,"destroy the Amalekites, for they have set themselves against thee in the way when thou camest forth out of Egypt."
28274,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst",,thou rebel against the commandment of the LORD?
28275,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things",,"which were to be destroyed, and brought them into the camp."
28276,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of",,"the LORD, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."
28277,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn",,away thy fierce wrath.
28278,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid",,his hand on Saul's thigh.
28279,And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent:,,"for he is not a man, that he should repent."
28280,So Samuel turned again after Saul;,,and Saul was glad to see him.
28281,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to",,me the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
28282,"And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women",,"childless, so shalt thou be childless, both thy mother and thy father."
28283,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went,,to Gibeah.
28284,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt",,do.
28285,And Samuel did that which the,,Lord commanded.
28286,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked",,on them with favor.
28287,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and",,"said, ""Come, bring the ark of God into your house."""
28288,Then Jesse made Shammah,,his second in command.
28289,"Again, Jesse made seven of his",,ten free throws.
28290,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul,",,and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
28291,"And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now,",,an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
28292,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a",,"man that can play well, and bring him to me."
28293,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send",,"me thy son David, which is with the sheep."
28294,"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,",,"and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul."
28295,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and",,"he said unto him, Behold, my lord, I have come to play before thee; for I am a skilful player."
28296,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee,",,stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
28297,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at",,"Aphek, in the land of the Philistines."
28298,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by",,the valley of Elah.
28299,"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood",,on a mountain on the other side.
28300,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,",,"named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
28301,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs,",,and a helmet of brass upon his head.
28302,And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head,,weighed six hundred shekels of iron.
28303,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this",,"day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
28304,When Saul and all Israel heard those words of,,"the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid."
28305,And David was the youngest: and,,"the eldest was Eliab, and the second Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
28306,But David went and returned from Saul,,to his house.
28307,And the Philistine drew near morning and,,"evening, and stood and cried against Israel."
28308,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of",,"this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren."
28309,"And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand,",,"and look how he fareth, and bring me word again."
28310,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel,",,"were gathered together at Gilgal, and stood before the Philistines."
28311,For Israel and the Philistines had put,,For Israel and the Philistines had put their armies in array to battle.
28312,And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the,,carriage.
28313,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw",,"him, fled from him and were sore afraid."
28314,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So",,"be it, as thou hast said."
28315,"And David said, What have I now",,done?
28316,"And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same",,manner.
28317,"And when the words were heard which David spake, they",,told them to Joab.
28318,"And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because",,of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
28319,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came",,"a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"
28320,Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be,,as one of them.
28321,"And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put an helmet of",,brass on his head.
28322,And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David;,,and David ran quickly toward the army to meet the Philistine.
28323,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for",,"he was but a youth, ruddy and of a fair countenance."
28324,"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest",,to me with staves?
28325,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy",,"flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."
28326,And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear:,,"for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands."
28327,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to",,"meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
28328,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote",,"him, and slew him; so that there was no need of a sword in David's hand."
28329,And the children of Israel returned from chasing,,"after their enemies, and they gathered the spoil."
28330,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it",,to Jerusalem.
28331,"And the king said, Inquire thou",,whether the Lord will give us deliverance at his hand.
28332,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and",,brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
28333,"And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And",,"David said unto him, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
28334,"And Saul took him that day, and would let",,him not go home to his father's house.
28335,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because",,he loved him as his own soul.
28336,"And the women answered one another as they played, and said,",,"""Behold, King Solomon hath excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom."""
28337,And Saul eyed David from,,that day on.
28338,"And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I",,will pin David to the wall.
28339,"And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD",,was with him.
28340,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over",,a thousand.
28341,And David behaved himself wisely in all his,,ways.
28342,Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself,,"wisely, he stood in fear of him."
28343,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because",,he went out and came in before them.
28344,"And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my",,"father's house in Israel, that I should be king over Israel?"
28345,But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have,,"been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite."
28346,And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they,,"told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
28347,"And the servants of Saul told him,",,"saying, Behold, David is in the land of Gath."
28348,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to",,hear them.
28349,And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was,,with David.
28350,And Saul was yet the more afraid of,,David.
28351,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to",,"all his servants, that they should kill David."
28352,And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul,,"sware, saying, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain."
28353,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan",,"said unto him, Fear not; for thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and Saul my father shall know it"
28354,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the",,Philistines.
28355,"And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in",,his house with his spear in his hand.
28356,So Michal let David down through a window:,,"and he escaped, and went his way."
28357,"And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a",,"pillow of goats' hair for his head, and covered it with a cloth."
28358,And when Saul sent messengers to take,,"David, David was warned by Jonathan and fled."
28359,"And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him",,up to me.
28360,"And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image",,of a great idol in the house.
28361,"So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah,",,and told him all that Saul had done to him.
28362,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold,",,the Philistines are fighting against Israel.
28363,"And when it was told Saul, he",,was very angry.
28364,And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon,,"him, and he prophesied among them."
28365,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul",,"desireth, I will do it for thee."
28366,"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if",,"he say thus, I have no pleasure in it; then will we prepare ourselves for trouble."
28367,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me?",,Saul hath certainly sworn to do thee evil; who will tell me if he intend to do so again?
28368,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and",,let us go out into the field.
28369,And thou shalt not only while yet I live show,,"thyself kind to me, but also to my posterity."
28370,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let",,the Lord require it at the hand of Jonathan’s enemies.
28371,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:",,for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
28372,"Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon:",,"and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty."
28373,And I will shoot three arrows on the side,,"of the target, one after another."
28374,"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are",,"on the ground, then do thou go thy way."
28375,And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken,,"of, be sure that I will keep it secret."
28376,So David hid himself in the field: and when the new,,"moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat."
28377,"Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something",,"is restraining him, it will be made clear in due time."
28378,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked",,"of me to let him go and fight against the Philistines, and he said, 'Who is my father's house that you should set your"
28379,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,",,Why should he be put to death? What has he done?
28380,And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan,,knew that his father would slay David.
28381,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the",,field to meet David.
28382,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find",,me a bottle of oil.
28383,And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had,,"shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, saying, Go, find the arrow."
28384,"And Jonathan cried after the lad,",,"""Go, be strong and courageous."""
28385,But the lad knew not any thing:,,he was as innocent as a newborn lamb.
28386,"And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and",,"said unto him, Go, carry them to the camp."
28387,Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves,,"of bread in mine hand: for I have come a great way, and there is no food in the place to which I am going."
28388,And David arose and fled that day for fear of,,Saul.
28389,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and",,went his way.
28390,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man",,is as harmless as a lamb.
28391,"Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play",,the prophet before me?
28392,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren",,"and all his father's house heard it, they came down there to him."
28393,And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt,,with him.
28394,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said,",,"I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
28395,"And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him",,"the oil in the flask, and he poured it out, and it covered the surface of the water."
28396,"And Saul said, Hear now,",,"my son Jonathan, I will not go back."
28397,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die,",,"said the king, and his voice was like the rumble of distant thunder."
28398,And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son,,"of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and went to David."
28399,And Abiathar showed David that Saul,,was seeking to kill him.
28400,"Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life",,seeketh thine also.
28401,"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines",,are fighting against the Israelites.
28402,"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines?",,"And the LORD said unto David, Go, smite the Philistines, and save Keilah."
28403,"And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how",,much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
28404,Then David inquired of,,the Lord.
28405,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to",,"David, that he came with an ephod in his hand."
28406,"And Saul called all the people together to war, to",,go against the Philistines.
28407,And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and,,"he was afraid, and said to Abiathar the priest, ""They have told me, 'Behold, the soul of Saul seeks to"
28408,"Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that",,"Saul seeketh to come down against this city, to destroy it."
28409,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into",,the hand of Saul?
28410,And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life:,,"and David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
28411,"And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David",,"and said unto him, Surely thou art my brother, for I have seen the love that hath passed between thee and my father."
28412,And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David,,"said unto Jonathan, God do so and more also to me, if I know not the mind of my father to tell it thee."
28413,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to",,receive thy servant.
28414,"And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the",,LORD.
28415,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men",,were in the wilderness of Maon.
28416,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee,",,and come away quickly.
28417,"Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went",,against the Philistines.
28418,"And David went up from thence, and",,dwelt in strong holds.
28419,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that",,"it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi."
28420,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went",,to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
28421,"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart",,smote him because he had cut off the skirt of Saul's robe.
28422,"So David stayed his servants with these words,",,"""Be strong and let us act valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what is good"
28423,"And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou",,"men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?"
28424,"The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge",,me of thy wickedness.
28425,"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from",,the wicked.
28426,After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom,,After whom is the king of Israel come out? After David
28427,"The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and",,"see and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand."
28428,"And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for",,"thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil."
28429,And thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch,,"as thou hast met me face to face, and hast not slain me."
28430,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore",,I would not let mine enemy go unscathed.
28431,"And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,",,and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
28432,And David sware,,"unto Jonathan, saying, Thy father knoweth certainly that I have found favour in thine eyes."
28433,And David heard in the wilderness,,the voice of the Lord.
28434,"And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get",,"you up to Bethlehem, and thus shall ye say to Jesse, and to his sons, Thus saith David your servant."
28435,"And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to",,thee and to thy house.
28436,"And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according",,"to all those words in his name, but he would not hearken unto them."
28437,"So David's young men turned their way, and went",,on the road.
28438,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent",,"messengers out of the wilderness to greet thee, and thou hast snubbed them."
28439,"They were a wall unto us both by night and day,",,keeping us safe from harm.
28440,"And she said unto her servants, Go on",,your way.
28441,"So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of",,all that pertain to him so much as one.
28442,"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and",,"bowed herself to him, and fell at his feet, and said, ""Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be"
28443,"And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let",,it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
28444,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God",,"of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:"
28445,"And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this",,day from sin.
28446,"And it came to pass about ten days after,",,"that the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,"
28447,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto",,"her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife."
28448,David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they,,became his wives.
28449,"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to",,Phalti the son of Laish.
28450,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David",,"hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, before the wild?"
28451,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand",,"chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
28452,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood",,that the city was not prepared for a siege.
28453,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can",,"stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?"
28454,"David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his",,day shall come to die; or else he shall go down to battle and perish.
28455,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the",,top of the hill.
28456,"And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son",,David?
28457,"And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?",,"For what have I done, or what evil is in my hand?"
28458,"And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let",,one of the young men come over and fetch it.
28459,"And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that",,"were with him, and they went to Achish, the king of Gath."
28460,And it was told Saul that David was fled to,,Gath.
28461,Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag,,belongeth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
28462,And the time that David dwelt in the country of,,the Philistines was a full year and four months.
28463,"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly",,to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
28464,"And David said to Achish, Surely thou",,shalt know what thy servant can do.
28465,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem:",,"and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa."
28466,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines,",,"he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled."
28467,"And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him",,not at all.
28468,"And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD",,"liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing."
28469,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up",,to thee?
28470,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the",,"woman said, ""Why have you deceived me? You are Samuel!"""
28471,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And",,"the woman said unto him, I saw the spirit of my husband."
28472,"Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing",,"the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?"
28473,"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath",,"upon Amalek, therefore the LORD hath done this thing unto thee this day."
28474,"And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and",,"killed it, and dressed it, and set it before them."
28475,"And she brought it before Saul, and",,"said, ""Behold, the man whom you seek."""
28476,Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and,,the Israelites pitched their camp at Ebenezer.
28477,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands:",,and the people of Israel were sore afraid of the Philistines.
28478,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in",,"the dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
28479,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that",,I may tell my lord what thou hast said unto me.
28480,So David and his men rose up early to depart in,,the morning.
28481,"And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any,",,"either small or great, but carried them away, and took for themselves all the spoil."
28482,"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned",,"with fire, and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives."
28483,Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their,,voice and wept.
28484,"And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the",,"Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess."
28485,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son,",,"""Is there not here under your hand a spear or a sword?"""
28486,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,",,"and they went over to the land of Gath, to Achish, the son of Maoch, the king of Gath."
28487,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind,",,for they were too faint to cross the brook.
28488,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and",,gave him bread to eat and water to drink.
28489,"We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which",,"belongs to the Philistines, and we destroyed their cities and fortifications."
28490,And David recovered all that the Amalekites had,,"taken, and rescued his two wives."
28491,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters,",,"neither food nor drink, neither wealth nor health."
28492,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they",,"drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's present to the king, and to his household, for a blessing."
28493,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made",,it his mission to help others in need.
28494,"To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were",,"in Ai, and to them which were in all the cities of the land."
28495,"And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which",,"were by the river, on this side and on that side."
28496,"And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities",,"of the Philistines, and to them which were in the land of Gath."
28497,"And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which",,"were in Ibleam, and to them which were in Beth-shemesh, and to them which were in Beth-anath, and to them"
28498,"And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the",,"And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the tribes of Israel,"
28499,Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled,,"from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
28500,And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;,,"and they slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons."
28501,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers",,hit him.
28502,"And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he",,fell likewise on his sword and died.
28503,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his",,"armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together."
28504,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip",,"the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa."
28505,And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth:,,and sent his head and his armor to various parts of their territory.
28506,And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of,,"what had happened to Saul and his sons, they were greatly distressed."
28507,"And they took their bones, and buried them under",,the oak tree in the field.
28508,"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned",,"from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and had abode two days in Ziklag;"
28509,"And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said",,I am a Philistine.
28510,"And David said unto the young man that told him, How",,knowest thou that Saul is dead?
28511,"And when he looked behind him, he",,"saw nothing but the vast, empty desert stretching out to the horizon."
28512,"And he said unto me, Who art thou?",,"And I said unto him, I am an angel of the Lord."
28513,"He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:",,for I cannot die until I am slain.
28514,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them;",,"and he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned."
28515,"And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?",,"And the young man that told him answered, I am an Amalekite."
28516,"And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid",,to slay the LORD's anointed?
28517,"And David called one of the young men,",,"and said, ""Go, I pray thee, and fetch me a piece of bread."""
28518,"And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy",,life is in thy own hand.
28519,And David lamented with this lamentation over,,Saul and his son Jonathan.
28520,(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of,,the bow.)
28521,The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy,,high places.
28522,"Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest",,"the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
28523,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow",,was made strong.
28524,"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death",,they were not divided.
28525,"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet,",,"with other delights, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel."
28526,How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the,,battle!
28527,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been",,"unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."
28528,"How are the mighty fallen, and",,the strong laid low.
28529,"So David went up thither, and his two wives also,",,Ahinoam and Abigail.
28530,"And his men that were with him did David bring up, every",,man and his household.
28531,And now the LORD show kindness and truth unto you: and I,,also will show kindness to you for walking in his ways.
28532,"Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul",,"is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
28533,"But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took",,"Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
28534,"And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over",,"Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Manasseh, and over all Israel."
28535,Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he,,"began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years."
28536,And the time that David was king in Hebron over,,the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
28537,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth",,went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
