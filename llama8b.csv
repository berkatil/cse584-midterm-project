23347,He looked at the luminous,,"clock on the wall, its glowing hands ticking away the seconds, and wondered where the night had gone."
23348,It was five,,o'clock in the morning when I heard a loud noise.

23374,Then at least he would have a place to,,"live, where he could find comfort and support in a difficult time."
23375,After that everything,,"went back to normal, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something had shifted inside of me."
23376,He went upstairs,,to get a book from the shelf in his room.
23377,To his amazement,,"he stumbled upon a hidden treasure buried beneath the roots of his family's old oak tree, something that had been lost for generations."
